Dissapointing maybe, but not misleading.
I like that my approach to my computer is the same as my approach to my room. Don't throw anything away, and when I need to clean I just put everything in boxes and shuffle them off somewhere under my bed.
oh, believe me, them bitches in pain.
Yeah, stellar refutation there.  Please feel free to continue your Red Chinese fantasy without making any points.

Nope.

All research I was shown in school said that they did things like lay flowers on the graves of their dead, wore makeup (that was a recent news story), they did cave paintings first, and from what I've read our ancestors were much more violent and probably doomed the neandertals. 
You said:  &gt; The Chinese fought back when MacArthur's troops were closing in on the Chinese borders [...] MacArthur wanted to pick a fight with China because he thought America could handle it.  So you weren't referring to the early stages of the war when you said that MacArthur was picking a fight with China.  At that point, the US had shit well in hand their "defeat" was far from "assured".
He just dropped out of ludicrous speed.

I don't have any particular *requirement* per say that it has to be a WP plugin. I'm a bit of a beginner, WP was just easy to get up and running and I figured there'd be a plugin already existant. I just need a simple solution that I can add to what I've got that will let each person log in to see their balance and then pay it.
Mine too. 
i find your comment personally offensive. 
I like, where did you get the big time/date weather thing?  And where'd you get the background?  And cowboybebop and carl sagon's cosmos.  You know what, just give me a copy of your harddrive.
My friends nominated me as the choosen one who could leap this hurdle.   But not yet.

COuple problems with your thinking.  Displacement is not the same as a cessation of existence.  If you move from point A to A', then you have *displaced* but not ceased to exist.  This is made plain by the fact that your body can still be measured.    Further, I believe your perspective on movement is inconsistent with relativity.  A key part of relativity is that there is no preferred reference frame.  As such, it is impossible to have any absolute speeds - only relative.  NB: I wish to remind that quantum mechanics is not applicable to humans.  It stops working on scales about that of the atom.
Yep, reason and love are all they conserve. The country isn't talking to them anymore but they haven't noticed yet.

I can safely say that this scene scared me more than any scene in any movie ever has.  The sensation was of being actually paralyzed and having difficulty breathing while ice water was being poured on my neck, down my back.    EDIT: I did not and will not click the link.  
Dude, PDF *kills* firefox. 
We would tell a manager if it seemed to be a problem.  erections weren't allowed so most people would just cover them up if they got one on accident.  I would never report someone if I thought it was an accident, but if they were being pervy we could get them kicked out.    This one time there was an old old man who came into our restaurant with a huge boner, he must have had 2 or 3 blue helpers, and it was probably the only one he was getting that year.  Well, it seemed he was just trying to get away from the crowds and calm down, so I left him alone, but one of my friends got pissy about it and called the manager over who told him he had to cover it up.  The old man got really defensive and he shouted "My arm's hard do I have to cover that up too?" Hysterical.  
what are you going to put in it? :D
Thanks.  That's what I figured.  I have ridden past the dirt track everyday for about 5 years on the way to work and thought about riding it.  On Saturday I rode the track.  It's long, but relatively flat making it fast enough to ride, for fun on the way to work.  I was told by the guy I'm buying the bike from that doing that everyday will kill the bike.  But I'm not sure about that.....
Because you comment was really far down on the page, so the version of it I, and the other people responding to it saw after reading the rest of the page was an incorrect comment with several upvotes.
I wonder how many of us will have Steam on our desktops.
Big time/date is Rainmeter with some very basic configuration. The theme is Dark_Rainmeter.  [Wallpaper is here](http://imgur.com/rDV47.jpg). It probably came from /wg/ or [wallbase](http://wallbase.net).
I assume the 360 version is similar enough to the pc version. Once you hit fire, you have about 5 seconds to put your crosshairs on your target before the missiles hit. The missiles aren't actually shooting out of the UAV chopper, they're coming in from somewhere else, which is why there is a delay between hitting fire and hitting the target.

I'm not depressed myself. But I know what it's like for the thread creator, for I've been there. And very little actually helps when you're at the bottom of the pit of despair.   I actually gave him similar advice to yours about staying busy.
They would just cover it up. Everyone was required to have a towel to sit on so there was always fabric lying around.  I guess that could also be a good time to flip onto your stomach to tan = ) I honestly only had to make an issue out of it a few times.  
The first one is a great great movie.  I think the phone turning into his tongue freaked me out the most.

Fair enough, but come on now. You're first telling me it's not different at all, and now telling me there are all sorts of subcultures I'm dismissing with a broad brush.   Yes, Nashville is a city, but like I said, I work with folks in the rural area who are "country" and I wanted to be less awkward. NOW I FEEL REALLY AWKWARD, THX :(

The 38 minute thing has been broken when mass amounts of energy is applied, that's also in the same SG1 episode where the gate exploded(piggy backed on the x-302). As for the force shutdown, the existence of the iris on the atlantis stargate sorta proves it doesn't exist. Ports open by default, can't manually block addresses/connections, relies exclusively on a poor firewall for security.  Also you can jump wormhole from one gate to another.

Only a bus full of children? I caught an [airplane](http://www.needlenose.com/i/swopa/PlaneHudson.jpg) and they served my a 40 inch [cat fish](http://boojwah.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/man-eating-catfish2.bmp) for supper. Talk about a great catch.
Oh, man.  That's really unfortunate.  I guess, for her sake, I just hope he gets caught screwing up before she's stuck with him.  Ugh, how awful.  I wonder why he's so terrified you're going to tell her if you have no way of doing so?  Odd...

Cool! Internet taught me something new today. I'll insist that they either walk or sit together from now on!  Thanks all of you!
Definitely not-- you don't even need to be the creator. Any admin can disband the group at any time, which raises a lot of issues. 
I did commit these crimes. As I said I do not make excuses for myself. Had I been simply at the wrong place at the wrong time, I wouldn't have ran away.  I did fear a bit about the bondsman, but it is relatively easy to change your name in my country, all other elements being the same. My attorney kept pushing and pushing the court date. He was awesome.
most guys quit because they weren't making any money whereas for me 150-200 was a horrible day.

Yeah, the album is alright. I haven't listened very closely to the new stuff. Do you know [Myka 9](http://www.last.fm/music/Myka+9) from Project Blowed? His new album is tight if you're into smooth rolling beats and rapping.
She would certainly love that!
ooh, yeah. the great owl with all the cobwebs.
I don't know if he doesn't know that I can't tell her. But he texted me all last night trying to talk me down
Says who?
That is one cluttered system tray.
You are right.  Submitting a link via tiny url is WAY more important than the trade deficit.  Thanks for setting me straight on this one.  *sigh*
Ok  you just did not understand my post at all. In the begining of the korean war America was getting it's ass handed to it, they were about to be driven into the sea, they were almost ready to pack home when the tides of war changed and began to have more success, MacArthur went on a roll and succeeded in pushing back North Korean forces back a bit. Now MacArthur was under direct order from the president to not go up the 38 if there were any sign of Chinese opposition there, which there were, MacArthur said fuck it we can take those commies and engaged them, which was a really bad move on his part because the Chinese did not get the memo about American superiority and had a very different opinion about that, so they pushed back in force and the rest is history. 
Fiiinally
I can't believe you're even comparing them.
No, I am from a country in Europe. This is all I am willing to say. I crossed by air. I considered going to Mexico in car and flying from there, but I considered it a waste of time. This was in the pre-911 era. Taking a plane was a breeze.

Of course it wasn't defined it was being used incorrectly.  It specified one type of data.  Using it with another type was wrong hence why it wasn't defined.  Are you suggesting that the documentation contains expected return values for every type of incorrect data that's passed?
Actually, course of events:  1) amazon.com  2) noticed that it's darn impossible to get all the books in one set  2) went to wikipedia to get the complete list of books (perhaps to purchase separately)  3) realized that he's a board member for [NOM](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Organization_for_Marriage)  4) had the following thought: "WHY DOESN'T TALENT AUTOMATICALLY MAKE YOU NOT-A-JACKASS!?"  5) decided to buy something of Terry Pratchett's instead  Edit: I have a library card. The library carries Card's books. Yay!
How exactly did you manage to get on a plane and through customs on the other end without a passport?
Hard drugs - anything from cocaine to heroin. I cannot tell my country of origin but it is in Europe. I went to the United States to work because I was quite competent in my field. That event was a massive life changer because obviously I was not going to work in that field again, once back in my country. I realized I did not like it so much, anyway. I live a completely different life now.

Hahah...such a logical response. I never said using a computer or telephone was bad. I even specified [because I knew some tool would complain] "reading a full length book...' But it's okay.

Which is why rainman (and you if you're in Vancouver) should drop by City Hall after the games are over and participate in getting issues addressed. Make no mistake, we've lost a lot, but we've got a lot more to lose-- theatrics might raise some eyebrows but it could do more harm than good, which is what I'm hoping to avoid. 
just shoot them or kill the UAV operator, if you've got the anti air vehicle, just fire upon the helicopters and UAVs, there's really not much more you can do.
Very cool. If I may ask, how does one land editing gigs like this?
I don't really see how that is comparable, but whatever.  
WOman, actually, but thanks! :-)
Yeah, me too. I'm almost elderly now. But I think I still remember some of my expert driving techniques should I ever need them...I get a kick out of seeing car chases like in the Jason Bourne films.

i do program a bit and thus use both macs and pcs. both pcs and macs handle flash quite well, but to say that the pc can handle flash without a problem is just a lie. every browser crashes without fail whenever there is flash on many webpages even after uninstalling and reinstalling everything internet related on the pc. we tend to forget that when actually being successful running it, but it's just matter of fact.

I guess you're assuming that I'm American (I'm not), but I'm speaking from my experience.  Certainly, other people have different experiences. The question is simply, "what stereotypes do YOU believe hold true?"

So he can be Bush?  The DoJ comes down with a decision he doesn't like so he tosses them all, even though they are doing their jobs properly?
At first, I was completely scared. I feared Interpol, CIA agents coming for me, even my own local force (in other words, I was afraid the US would contact the police in my country and have me arrested). I was also afraid of the bondsman who bailed me out, and even felt a bit guilty about it at first (I even wanted to repay the $85,000 I still owed him). Then I got over it and live a new life.  I have a new name, I live in a house house, I have a new profession now and I am married. It would be nearly impossible to link me with my old life without extensive researches. Since these researches were never made in the 10+ years, I have no reason to believe they will be done now.

Thanks for pointing me to that AMA, it's very interesting.  Edit: Out of curiosity, how old are you? The OP of the other AMA is 25 and it would be interesting to hear from someone with a different perspective. Also, he did two AMAs 3 months apart that both generated interest. So if you ever have spare time, I'm sure reddit wouldn't mind another sailors view some day.

Couldn't find it for free anywhere?
Here in Az I thought the prices were slightly higher (for some reason I thought I last saw them around 120). But if its in good condition 99$ isn't bad.  I paid over 100$ for mine when I got it, but I also added a bunch of stuff like ammo and ammo pouches to my order which inflated it by a few bills.
alas, I have yet to learn those expert techniques. someday... I may take a performance driving course. but any advice in terms of learning those driving techniques from a master such as yourself?
&gt;What do you do for money now?  I work in a new field. I studied a bit in my country, now live a perfectly decent life - free, most of it.   &gt;What was the experience of starting completely fresh in a new country like?   Sorry I was not clear - I went from my home country to the United States, then back to my home country.   &gt;Was it hard to get work/proper identification without having any documents?  It was extremely easy. I simply said I lost my passport and was given another. Later on, however, I started anew, with a new identity. That was also surprisingly easy (although a bit expensive). Changed my name, filed for EVERY paper, etc. Took a bit of time, but really not that hard.
I wish it were that... the reality is that I am at work and have confidential things on the desktop. If only...
&gt;You're first telling me it's not different at all, and now telling me there are all sorts of subcultures I'm dismissing with a broad brush.  In general, yes, they are just Americans, and behaving the only way you know how is gonna get you by. But the conventions and cues of different cities/areas matter if you're in those areas. But, it's not like there's some huge faux pax you can commit in one place that won't matter in another.   Really, the divide is gonna be rural vs suburban vs city.   So, if you're in the city, be a little colder as a person, in the country, be a bit warmer. Know that city people aren't gonna trust anyone, and rural people probably won't trust people they don't know. 
People can write their own apps for it and distribute them, they just can't distribute them on a large scale. Admittedly this is not optimal but I do like the simplicity of having one source for all the apps. Is there a way to give developers total freedom while still maintaining the current simplicity? 
Are you incredibly racist?
i can 100% agree with that sentiment, and for sure agree with the live experience aspect. thats what i was looking for when i posted this, never really can find anyone who can gracefully and calmly talk about it with me....it is such an opinionated question.
Are you trying to calculate the chance of getting a BSOD with that many folders open?
Yes, actually.
I started out waiting tables, then someone in the nightclub got me a job there where the tips were better.  I also served drinks poolside.  We could choose to be topless, but I usually didn't.  The last few months that I was there I worked in their spa, and didn't deal with drinks or food at all.  
does your wife have any idea at all? If you have a new identity, are you even in contact with your family?
Well that's too bad.  If I had been able to gauge the bullshit from the truth I would have joined.  I would have been thrilled to be in CT.

English's not my native language (although I did study it early in school, so I shouldn't be making excuses!) but I thought my sentence was clear:  "It costed me quite a bit, but I was able to take someone's identity long enough to make it back to a country next to mine,"  I took a plane to a country next to mine, then took the train to my country. I.E. I flied oversea to some country in Europe and went by train to my own country.

I don't think I can base my entire point of view on people from a particular state on the actions of a few.  That would be bigoted...

It's also worth noting that the CS:S versions of maps, while mostly similar, do have some differences.  For example, on dust2, CS:S has two sets of double doors between T spawn and long A, whereas the original version of the map only had one set of double doors at this point.
ACLU filed an friend-of-court brief to permit corporate free speech.  They received quite a bit of negative press from their friends on the left wing.  So the ACLU considered dropping the brief and staying out of the case altogether.  Abrams persuaded the ACLU to stay in the fight on the corporate side for free speech.  Even now, the ACLU has remained silent on their share of the victory and wants to keep it hush hush.    The whole thing is funny, because they know it was the right thing, both legally and ethically.  Furthermore, the ACLU have had to pull campaign ads against Republicans in many past races.  Now they can run those ads to benefit the leftist political ideology that hates this decision - the irony is sweet.  Make no mistake.  The Democrat party and Obama, who ripped SCOTUS for this, are going to lead the charge for unions and other corporate partners to spend millions on their behalf.
Ok, fair enough.

Sure, I understand the basics of western physics, too. Just as an aside, Indian, Hindu literature and Vedic philosophy have a considerably different view of physics...of course, not when they are launching rockets into space; but, when 'conceptualizing' time.  I'm not convinced that there is not a 'leap' of measurement from the quantum to the atomic state, as I understand it, that ball is still up in the air. I mean, how can we not be entangled in the quantum state? That's not common sensible even, that's like saying, we're not entangled at the cosmic level. Besides, there's the element of time, it is according to physics the commonality that proves existence. And as Motorola, Intel, IBM, and all know...time rules at the quantum level as well as the atomic leve...otherwise, we wouldn't be able to be doing this right now, I mean communicating via these machines.
Sure you can.

All my family was in my home country, I had no family in the United States (I did have friends and coworkers though. Never saw them or heard about them again). My wife knows about my past.

What if they include in their definition of sodomy oral sex or anal sex among heterosexual couples? I agree, a lot of morality laws go largely unenforced, but it's still disheartening to still see this kind of thing. Granted, "God Hates Fags" is worse, but this still sucks.

Cool. Ok tho one question. If they live believing a lie, but that lie doesn't impede and even helps a happy life, a good career, a family, helping the unfortunate, and a peaceful death...is it still "throwing their life away?"  I'm an atheist too, but I was raised in a freaky serious Christian denomination, and I still have a soft spot for the people there.  Did something happen in your life that made you hate Christians?  
Heh, turns out it wasn't Disney, but thanks for the link.
It's actually not Dec 25th or any winter date at all. The reason why we have Christmas on Dec 25th is because it was a pagan holiday celebrating the noticeable shortening of daylight. When Christian evangelists (crusaders?) converted them, they just made their most popular holiday their own to make the conversion smoother.  I believe Christ's birthday was more around April or something.  Edit: [wiki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas)
that sounds just like something an ASIAN GIRL would say.

I see what you mean. Not only am I doing a mostly fruit diet with cardio, but I'm also trying to cut down the amount I eat. Most of it is muscle, but I haven't been working out for the past month or so. The chub mostly accumulated in my lower stomach.
I'm glad you agree! I especially liked the part where I used it to illustrate the fairly obvious fact that buttons with covers keep people from accidentally pressing them.
I like clean bikes.  So I'll keep it clean.  Thanks for the feedback.
Indeed they are not, they are a) just born and have not grown any meat and b) are of a different kind than those used for meat production, so they are being killed and disposed of without "serving any purpose".
Yes, thank you.  The hardest part was holding it over my head.
Count me as a heathen. I lived in the Thousand Islands for a while and still live in that region so I cannot deny it. Although I am a mustard freak.
Excuse my ignorance but what's a self-clean cycle?
Thanks! The subject is an oversized brandy snifter filled with water, with two drops of red food colouring added. The snifter is on a raised platform draped in black felt and the background is a sheet of black bristol board. All lighting comes from a flash with a homemade snoot (to create the narrow beam) placed behind the snifter. It's aimed upwards to illuminate the bristol board, providing backlighting.
It was linked to from some other thread; I had it in a tab and forgot that it was old until after posting in it.

So was born casual Friday.
The months around the harvest are the worst, August-November. Winter really slows down though, and then, as expected, once the warmer months hit, it starts to pick up again. Although rainy days tend to keep people away. 
yeah I saw that - I took it to mean she basically didn't know and wasn't going to just make something up  if MS were assured everything was above board, they've gone ahead believing they have permits, whether those permits actually exist or not  maybe there's a case for not enough due diligence but again, they're at arms-length from the people on the street actually making it happen - even though **they're** the ones with egg on their faces when faeces meets propeller-blade...
Early adopters always suffer some, but it’s manageable. As for you, you don’t have to buy an iPad or an iPhone if you don’t want to. Just sit back and enjoy as more and more sites start supporting HTML5 instead of exclusively Flash. You don’t even have to thank Apple for it if you don’t want to.
If I was a robot, I think my head would be exploding right now.
Wheats should **never** be put into a secondary, you can't achieve clarity with them - they are simply cloudy by nature.  But if your fermentation isn't complete, racking too early can terminate fermentation.  IMO, a few extra days (but just a few) is better than too few days.  A *slight* off-taste from sitting on the yeast cake too long is better than an underattenuated brew!

Oh man.  ok so there was this cult that used to come to our resort about once a year or so.  The leader lived in Texas and was loaded, and he had couples from all over the country meet him there for a week.  It was usually 3 or 4 couples.  It was the strangest thing ever.  They always found new ways to get themselves in trouble.    One day (middle of the day, broad daylight) they all order fruity drinks with extra fruit.  The girls are all sitting on the pool ledge, and the guys were in the pool.  They hid the fruit in their kooters, and the guys played a hide and seek contest.  
you need protein as well as fruit, especially if you are exercising

Yes, art is better than totalitarianism.
Actually, having one homosexual experience does make you high risk for HIV infection. You may not like it, may not agree with it but statistically speaking your chances of catching HIV are greatly increased. Medical authorities have decided it is not worth the risk of infection to accept high risk blood donors at this time.   This doesn't only apply to homosexual behavior. IV drug users are also included. Hell, after I spent time traveling overseas I could not donate blood for three years because I spent time in a number of malaria infested areas. I took anti-malaria medication (full course including pre, during and post exposure) but this didn't, the risk to blood recipients was too high. 
Yes, and since I didn't do it that often I think it was that much more of an increase.
If you haven't dumped it yet, it may still be good.  It will be preserved just fine in the bottles (think of it as a mini-secondary) and you could crack them all open, combine in keg, and force carb.  You may not have the equipment yet, but it could save your batch and be a smart investment.  Personally, I like bottles better, but I had so many problems early-on with carbing properly... I wish I had just started kegging earlier.

I'm not sure what you're talking about. Just like there was only one Highlander movie there was only one Matrix film. A good sequel would be awesome though.
Know people. All about knowing people, one minute im talking to good friend of mine, a photographer, (youll see all his new shots of Sullivan soon on which I was helping by holding a light in Sullivan's face :P) and the next we're having pork dumplings and showing each other iphone apps, then I'm cutting a showreel for him.

&gt; How is a regulation that allows only one ISP in an area ensure competition?  Exactly. It doesn't. My point was that regulation is *supposed to* be in place to ensure competition. That is why I am hesitant to call the policies of an incompetent government that simply gives out regional monopolies to the private sector "regulation", at least in any useful sense. But, of course, all of this gets in the way of a cheap shot at the much feared "socialism".  Also, Soviet Russia was not "socialist" in any useful sense.  &gt; Are you a economics major?  God no.

Wait....you're writing a book?  I read your blog on and off, but I had no idea that you were "real" writer...  What is the subject?
My argument is perfectly solid, and i have facts to back myself up. Have fun getting shot.
I certainly don't think the concept was anything fresh, nor that the idea of the concept was part of the enjoyment. I knew how it was going to end beforehand, someone had told me.  It was how this so perfectly manipulated you, that I found astonishing. I had a very strange feeling when I finished. On the one hand I felt peaceful and full of the glow of their love. Then you realise how this feeling floats on the surface and there is a maelstrom of emotions underneath – a mix of how much the film impacted you in it's first hour, and the fact that you know this ending is the beginning of a nightmare, you can't forget the horror and disgust, but you also know it's not just horror and disgust.  The more I think about it, the more I realise how great this movie was. (then again, it's still only 2 hours later).  
Surely, however, there is no *active* regulation, as the government has simply handed responsibility over to a single privately owned company and then completely removed themselves from the equation.
It's all the same to me, just different level of graphics and story.

With further study of the phase diagram, you can really understand how amazing water is.  Off the top of my head, water is the only one that has the line separating liquid and solid tilting to the left.  That means that it's the only thing that will liquify if adequate pressure is applied.  It's because ice is actually less dense than water.  When you add pressure, the crystal lattice structure of ice collapses, it becomes water.  The density thing is nifty, and it's why ice floats.  Since ice floats, life in water persists.    /streamofconsciousness
I didn't say you are mindless, did I?
That's not related to his comment at all. 
What about Coke Zero? Because that may be hard to give up ;)  And don't worry there is exercise in my diet, a cardio workout every day that burns about 450-500 calories (my elliptical says so!) But I certainly wouldn't want my blood sugar levels being all over the place.  Maybe the problem is more so the amount I eat because when I eat, *I eat*, know what I mean?  I probably shouldn't take advice from my crazy diet friend... although she certainly does look gorgeous.

The front desk was staffed by a sleepy old man who would dutifully ignore the elevator alarm bell when people got stuck in it (which happened 2 or 3 times a month) and would only allow people to pick up packages Monday-Friday before 4pm even though the front desk was staffed all day and night.

Like nearly everything, musical tastes are spread most often through word-of-mouth.  When a teenage girl hears from the "cool girls" that she should listen to some shitty pop music, her tastes may evolve to fit in with the image that's being sold to her.  When I was sitting there and some useless hippy that spends way too much time smoking pot comes up to me and says "Dude, you should listen to Phish, man...", it's pretty damning to my initial impression of the music, and shapes my taste for it.  It's just psychology.

I’ve used enough different anti-virus programs, including AVG and Avast to have learned that none are perfect and that they all catch different things.  I’ve been using Mallwarebytes’ for something over a year now and will probably stick with it.  I started with their free program and then switched over to the pay version, which cost me a one time $25 licencing fee.  My computer is about 7 years old and Mallwarebytes’ found and removed relics left behind by Symantec, etc.  After I installed it bootup got a **lot** faster.  I particularly like their fileASSASSIN tool which is an ace at deleting locked files.
As a user you only need to know what's returned if there was an error. (Exceptions and runtime exceptions really make things a lot cleaner.) Of course mentioning this stuff wouldn't be necessary if it were standardized, but...  `strlen(NULL)` returns 0.  `ord(NULL)` returns 0.  `imlode(NULL)` emits a warning.  `ltrim(NULL)` returns an empty string.  Yea, that's really awesome indeed. I'm sure that there is at least one person *somewhere* to whom this behavior makes a whole lot of sense. Probably. :)

Yeah... I used to drink that stuff when I was a poor teenager.  Now, somewhat paradoxically, I'm a beer snob.  Chimay FTW!

Sorry. Most stoves (electric or gas) have a self clean cycle that super heats the oven and turns any grease and food residue into nothing but ash. The oven actually locks itself and goes crazy for a few hours and can't be unlocked until it cools down. If your stove doesn't have this feature then you might try setting it as high as it will go and letting it run like that for 1 1/2- 2 hours and then allow it to cool back down to 150* or so.

And the Greek stories became Roman stories and the Roman people were slowly transformed into a Germanic people and the Germanic people spread across the waters to America transmitting culture and the stories.    To make out that Disney has done something wrong by taking these stories and "kidifying" them is just stupid.  Anything they have done has been more than most other people are doing to promote interest in Greek mythology.  Perhaps the kids that watch these movies will become motivated to seek out more information on it.   They are unlikely to do so with nothing to go on.  The stories themselves are by no means pure.
as tempting as it would be to shock the hell out of you with how much more widespread and graphic patient images can be, let me just refer you to:  http://www.springerimages.com/imagesMD/welcome/  try a search for herpes  you assume its making a mockery...perhaps you're right, but you dont know. for all you know these patients were asked for permission, and even if they weren't, you seem to have ignored my point that these images were not necessarily posted to "make a mockery" and may have been posted with more benevolent, albeit misguided, intentions in mind.  my only point is that your feigned outrage is premature and harmful to the greater cause of getting much needed resources to Haiti

what do you mean by ritual? Japanese doesn't believe in God.  and also there are many holy traditions and rules in soccer. for example, you have to wear the same costume as your teammate, you cannot use your hand to score a goal, you have to use soccer shoes, not other shoes like tennis shoes or boots, etc.  all the rules and traditions are so holy, come directly from God of Soccer, He who created and ordered the men to play the sport.  and yet, He doesn't allow any country to exclusively play the game. He distribute the enjoyment all around the world. He even show mercy if Thou cannot obey all the rules.

&gt;People relying on news and politicians for information is unavoidable. There should be laws against deliberate misinformation, is what I'm saying.  I agree with you 100%. It's a shame that Fox News uses the slogan of fair and balanced and yet is allowed to show opinion based "news". They should be held to some sort of standard when it comes to what they say since Fox is the most watched news network (or any news source for that matter) . I have a friend who believes everything on Fox is fair and balanced and will argue over any point until he is blue in the face, it is one of the most frustrating things I care to be around.

You must live in a very affluent area.

I have access to my own B&amp;W developing so that'd be fine. Although I do wonder how these slightly blurry pinhole photos would look in B&amp;W.  Now, as for exposure, that is puzzling me. The dude in the video appeared to have pulled the exposure time out of a hat...."it's sunny...so maybe one or two seconds". I would think for accurate values one would need to determine the f-stop of the pinhole. I suppose dividing the distance between pinhole and film by its diameter will be the answer. Heck, one could then even use a light meter. 
I do agree with you, but at the same time, I'm somewhat disappointed it didn't spawn a sequel, if not more than one.  I was looking it up after I saw the film, and apparently it's based on a fairly decent series of books.  Same thing with *The Saint* and *The Talented Mr. Ripley* (and by 'sequel', I mean within their respective interpretations, since I know all 3 have been *adapted* various times).
Invalid comparison. RP and WMP both sucked ass. Today, HTML5 apps are fine. It’s Flash that sucks ass.

Well if I can shoot unarmed intruders, all I have to do is make you look like an intruder, or make it look like I could have reasonably thought you were an intruder. Not exactly rocket science.  But by all means, let me know when they invent the magic mind reading lie detector.

So a potential employee would need to authorize the check, correct? 
No, that was the whole reason I bought a mac in 2004. Or rather, because it was a decent OS with a unix core. Sadly, an ibook G4 800mhz now is pretty useless for modern web usage.  Kickass for *nix admin stuff though :)

She's standing right here...but ok...
I guess ME1 was a little long winded running around the citadel but it could have been a hell of a lot worse. My only complaint about ME1 was managing weapon inventory, Eirches was right though, they over corrected in that area as well as in citadel quest and level design.   I'd say on a whole though the fixes in ME2 were all for the better, for ME3 they should take a lesson from boarderlands on looting/weapon design.   Also, they should phase out the hacking somewhere in the middle of the game so you can auto hack, i got pretty sick of connecting the dots. 
The pictures with the tests &amp; results really did it for me.
Appletini? No.   Definitely Not. Ok Maybe.
Is Destructoid also bad?  I always try to get into video game blogs, but I fall behind or just get obsessed with a Zelda game and ignore everything else 
The ACLU also has a history of defending churches, conservatives and other folks who undergo challenges to free speech.  They're remarkably unbiased when it comes to protecting free speech.  The problem, as they and Greenwald point out, is that challenging speech is unconstitutional, and we can't deny it to anyone.  What we need to do is attack the notion that corporations are people with protected rights, given that they're organizations that can drop one identity and adopt a new one the way other people can't.
Yep, it was directed by Nicholas Meyer, who directed Wrath of Khan.  I was an adult, who had been reading scifi half my life at that point, and thought I could easily handle some post-nuclear scenarios.  Had a big party with my friends to watch this on TV.  Completely embarrassed myself by bawling like a baby about 3/4 of the way through.  I was in no way ready for the emotional impact of that film.
You no longer believe? The truth is out there...
Not everyone is perfect, and I think that is the great thing about nudism.  You accept people for who they truly are.  Just because you throw some clothes on doesn't stop you from being old or over weight.  
Those patients pictures were taken with their consent, otherwise it is a violation of the patients rights and the doctor would be penalized.  Also, find me one where a doctor is in the picture posing and smiling.    Even if these patients in Haiti gave consent, facebook is not the place to show them, and if they don't serve some medical related purpose they shouldn't even be taken at all.   I don't think these Doctors should be fired and given the circumstances only some light disciplinary actions should be taken.  But people are acting like it is okay for a doctor to do take those sorts of pictures and post them on facebook.  It isn't.

I am in no position to deny we are assholes, but I hardly can agree with the implication that we sign on with glee to randomly kill 'whoever we find'...which is sort of what terrorists do.

Ugh.
Certainly religion is a symptom and not a cause, I just wanted to point out the sheer absurdity in the belief that god interacts on a tangible level. If he did indeed interact as the religious assert, he is doing a mighty shitty job of answering their prayers!

Choosing between sources that for various reasons provide you select information is a blatant denial of intelligence. It might not meet the technical qualifications of the term 'closed source intelligence', but the effect is similar. I must say though that I am by no means saying that the media in the U.S. is as bad as it is in China.
That doesn't count!

I do this too. Also, if you carry a sniper rifle on this build (which I have lovingly coined as the "runny/stabby build"), you get the added benefit of having a ghillie suit. Bonus: the sniper rifle doesn't hinder your running like heavier weapons. You would run the same if you had an SMG or a sniper rifle.

This is a common misconception that people (even some physicists that I've talked to) have. It turns out ice is slippery because the water molecules on the surface are only partially bonded to the crystal lattice and are free to sort of wiggle around and let you slip over them.  Check this article out; http://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/21/science/21ice.html  (Although all the facts in the article are correct as far as I can tell, they depict water as having three hydrogens in their diagram. Probably a graphics department mess-up.)
I was fat for the first 20 years of my life.  That caused a lot of teasing, etc.  But I know even morbidly obese people still manage to have friends, so other than that I don't know.  Maybe I just come off as an asshole.    There's always this cliche of "just go out and meet people lol!"  I can go out and interact with society for basic needs or even make inane elevator chat.  The thing is, though, is that I get out of the elevator or go home without any new friends.  I can tell that people really aren't interested in me, they're just being polite most of the time.

Of course.  I do find it interesting that all of the states at the top of the list are from the South, where there is a larger minority population who supposedly does not do as well at standardized tests.  There are fewer job opportunities, thus the theft and poverty.   Even if I were not a Christian I would fail to see religion as the connecting tissue between these stats.

Until everyone ceases to buy on credit, retailers will continue to build fees into their price.  You may convince a few people here and there to stop using credit, but you're unlikely to make a huge change in the behavior of the majority of consumers. Therefore, we might as well take advantage of the cash back.

Same here. Recently watched seasons 1-5 for the first time, some days only one or two, but having timeless marathons on others. The only bummer was Hulu was missing season 5, episodes 1-10 for some reason. Really threw off the whole chronology of the show for me. (Ha, j/k)

Yeah, I tried to calculate the f-stop of my matchbox camera that way, though I had to make an educated guess at the aperture of my "lens" (I think I Googled how big a pin point is). That's really the beauty of it, though, as it's not really that precise a science. You can kinda just make it up as you go and you end up with some neat photos.
&gt;I clicked the link while watching a movie with my husband  No I don't think you were actually watching a movie if you're clicking links on reddit. Sounds like your husband is watching a movie, and you were on reddit.

I think it's more that people assume fellow Reddit users to be male until proven otherwise.
This is a dumb thing to say. Why? How? Ubuntu is heavier in a few ways than a carefully tweaked install of some other distro, but not due to wastage; the extra weight is carrying around features, and while they may not be features you want, it's silly to call them "bloat", especially when you can remove them easily.
"quote my last comment" game?
No, I just thought I would quote your good advice.
No, they were at the bottom of the surf, about 10-15 feet from the beach. I would have bet everything that they were gone forever. We kept searching out of sympathy with no real hope and because he had no way to get home as driving blind is discouraged in our neck of the woods.

You are not alone. I thought it was a joke at first because it was affecting his speech, but no. Yikes. It would have been funny if his "inner robot" had the same teeth. 
That sounds like BS - in the military, "government rate" means "as close to your per diem max as we can make it" but still generally below the average room price. Same with airfare. Now maybe Congress has different per diem rates?

Your post is so perfectly retarded and poorly written that it's pretty damn comical.

You decided to post this here, so you must have thought it has something to do with Physics.  I disagree, that's all.    I've read your exchange with wackyvorion, but I don't see the answers to my questions anywhere in there.  Particularly this one: do you have a logical reason for making _any_ connection between awareness and higher dimensions?

You must be stupid.
Purple Extreme is the best chain lube btw.
Yep, sorry.
Plenty of tabs have stroke directions, they are represented below as ^/v below. Wahs and Rests can easily be represented, and I am inclined to believe you are comparing poor tablature with good sheet music, While representing the key is not as common on tab, it could so easily be done by writing "A Minor" above, which would work fine.  Tablature is so much more flexible whereas notation can be so restrictive. In earlier periods of music where standard forms were more prominent (medievil, baroque, classical) I believe notation would rarely find it's limits, now almost every day I see notation with scrawls of hand written notes above it giving additional input, so many accidentals that it renders the key practically redundant, translations from Latin to English because, sorry to break it to you, practicality should override tradition and we do in fact, speak English nowadays.  Anyway that's just my 0.02c.
No, I was just half-assed looking around, knowing for a fact they were gone forever and thinking about how to get to an optometrist before closing time. He was the one who found them. The blind man found his glasses in the ocean.

I don't believe in the one. If there is only one right person out there, the probability is that she's dead, about to die, starving, or already taken (in that order).  Ignoring the idea that there is only one right person has benefits too. For example, I was able to move on to new people after my ex cheated on me without the pain of decided whether or not she was the one. Discovering there are many "ones" out there for each of us makes it far easier to discover someone you are truly happy with.
B-(
Aye, being a session man demands that you can learn in almost any way thrown at you, and sight reading, reading tab and aurally learning would all be invaluable.

God is racist? WTF  Does god answer prayers or not? Does he effect positively the lives of his followers or not?  Look, if you ask ANY priest or pastor, they will lie that god answers prayers. Ask them about the negative correlation between religion and socioeconomic statistics. The stupider the people the more religious they are (not just America!)
No that was my other dog. You fucked them both? Bloody hell!
Correct - so is the problem private companies (by definitions, organizations of people created by voluntary arrangement to provide goods), or government (by definition, organizations of people who use coercion to enforce regulations and collect money)?

Actually it was 1987.  Bad Taste was filmed, written, directed, produced and edited by Peter Jackson (and friends). It was done on the cheap, filmed on weekends across 4 years for about $25k NZD. All the special effects were homemade, in particular the masks were baked in Peter Jackson's Mum's oven.    It's a particular testament to the film-making vision of Jackson himself. Also the filming process is a great example of the "No.8 wire" culture of New Zealanders innovating and coming up with inventive solutions from unlikely sources.   Peter Jackson also played a starring role as Derek in which he got to utter two of the best lines in movie history:   "Dereks don't die" and   "I'm born again"

Your perspective is screwed. Go on and tell me you would waste the best part of your life in jail. All of this would make sense if I even felt like I had committed a crime (which I don't).  Let's say you got to X and commit a crime. And X says you must purge 25 years in jail. You have a chance to run away to the United States. Would you? Just because a screwed, false, wrong system decides you should waste your life in jail doesn't mean you actually should. Your perspective is biased.  EDIT: Just realized you were trolling.

I would recommend the [Eclipse](http://eclipse.speedsubs.org/xdcc/alchemist) fansubs. They are the best so far.

We already have a Bass Pro in Memphis. I'm fine with another being built. I'm not so excited to house it in the Pyramid, complete with ad banners and billboards plastered to the sides, the first thing you see when you cross the bridge to Memphis. Perhaps you should check out my link to the Memphis skyline, and try a mental picture.  Also, perhaps you should actually go to a Contemporary museum and try to get something out of the experience.
Oh yeah, he said hes "Tight" with the local clinic great, and also dont tell me what I did and did not read...I was commenting on "just_a_regular_guy" who has negative karma points for being right. reddit is full of downvoting butt hurt nerds who are just looking for people to tell them how right they are about everything.

Not to be a jerk, but do you think you deserved time in jail for your actions? How do you justify the path you chose? Do you think that your "stupid mistake" didn't deserve to be punished? Surely if you were facing such a long time in prison, it wasn't a single mistake and it most certainly wasn't a small one.  e: Oh jeez did I upset reddit by asking the OP valid questions? Maybe he shouldn't do an AMA if he expected everyone to support what he did.
Ah, because a downvote from you is conclusive proof that there are no bots on Reddit.
I believe they are throwing their life away regardless by following a meaningless set of rules that stop them from indulging in some great things in life. And I don't "hate" Christians... They just piss me off when they try to force their beliefs upon me or others. (I do hate religion as a whole, though, but if somebody chooses to follow a religion, that's their choice.)

LOL  You've obviously never been in trouble with the law. On one side I wonder if I should be mean with you but on the other, you do not seem like a bad person, just a bit ignorant.  Lawyers frequently advise their clients to lie and will do anything to help their clients - if they are good attorneys, that is. The line between legal and not legal is very thin. You could commit two extremely similar crimes and get acquitted one time and 25 years the second time. Lawyers know how to do just enough so that either they don't break the law - but almost - or they break the law and make it  impossible to prove (they, after all, know what is necessary to prove a crime in court). 
O.O ......*brillllliant*.....

Um... put your tinfoil hat away. They won't be in control of the interweb, they are proposing subsidised infrastrucural development. 
Then when you said that you -have- given him time, what does he say?
I weep at the knowledge that you have bred.

and I would appreciate if you didn't call me that.
Well he thought it would be worse to file for bankruptcy, and would like to pay it, I really don't know what route he should take or if he will be banned forever just because his credit is bad?
No, I don't dislike the photo, I'm just saying "don't settle!"
Well, I *have* been married 22+ years, so I've had a little practice.
I bet I could welcome 100 new jokes.
Less horrible than the tribes he was preaching to, at the risk of sounding like an apologist.   Though I'd like to think I would have been disgusted by everyone's moral code had I been living back then in their civilization, I probably would have been a lot more tolerant of it.
What I posted was a joke. Anyway, I've slept outside, and I've been close to homeless in the past. As for cold climate, I'm in the Northwest Territories of Canada. At the moment, the temperature is a toasty -30C, without windchill.    
Am I really that bad a person?
Anyone know if this works on Ubuntu?

He's the one who brought the issue up, and first gave me the idea. He helped it materialize as well by delaying court proceedings.
How do they make money off of lawsuits?
Yeah, and with peerblock you can disable it instead of having to exit out of it completely. Whenever I play Battlefield 2 I have to disable it, but that's the only online game I've had trouble with for that reason. It is the only online game I play though, but I can have it on when I play Diablo 2 over lan through hamachi with my friend gary so I don't know. Just remember that if something isn't connecting right, check peerblock first.

A lot of the cost is that it is highly specialized training, so you need to pay for teachers who could make a lot of money actually practicing in their field rather than teaching. Also the materials for learning are not cheap at all. There is some very expensive equipment people need to be trained on, corpses to dissect are not cheap, etc.  Another factor, IMO, is to keep idealism to a minimum. No matter how idealistic you were when you started, by the time you can actually practice on your own, you have a quarter million in debt to worry about, so you can't just go off to a third world country and work for free, or help out poor people, or whatever you initially wanted to do. I see the same factor in a few other fields, notably law.
I agree they get hard when people mock and ridicule them. They feel this is God's way of testing them and when they feel this hatred or this mocking attitude it just encourages them to go further. Let them protest twitter and google or whatever the fuck they want. When they stop getting our attention they lose. 
I lost Miranda in that fight, i really didn't like jack at all but i thought in that argument Miranda was being unreasonable.  If/when i replay i will definitely side with Miranda, she was way more usefull in battle.  I also want to try maxing out biotics and using a combo group that can do aoe pull and then aoe throw, apparently it is powerful.   
Honestly I'm not sure. I'll see if my mother knows more about how hormone s in females effect energy levels and hopefully get back to you. She studies this kinda stuff incessantly so I might be able to get some useful information for you. Good luck finding an answer anyway!

How old were you when you saw it?  I were 14, and saw it with a bunch of friends, and we were laughing when she spun her head around. But I think maybe the movie would be scarier now. 
You're kind of putting words in my mouth, aren't you?  Race is not so much the issue as the culture surrounding race.    It seems that you have your mind made up.  For some reason you refuse to reasonably look at the statistics.  Instead you choose to equate the religious with stupidity, and the clergy with liars.  Sorry, but that just doesn't jive with me.  Cheers.  
Ding ding ding.  You win. 
I got the feeling my Lawyer friend in Honk Kong would concur.  I asked him recently how can an author sue google in China over a book she can not publish in China he responded in shock, "Laws?  Laws in China?"

The others will be dedicated to Physical and Host Infrastructures.   If you stop into a bookstore, I've got articles in both the regular and special edition of this month's Linux Pro Magazine.   Getting paid to write is _excellent_. 
You mean first generation Asian immigrants drive like shit.
KenpoX's intro, and the little douche walk he does toward the camera during AbRipper while he says, "P...90...X" all dramatic-like...such a douche.   But, it got me shape, so I'll allow it.
Fuck, I just got used to 2009.
ewwps, my bad, pussy-pancake.
I heard of him through one of my contact, but I do not think these attorneys are too rare, provided that you are willing to pay the price.  As for skipping bail, it's more frequent than you think - on purpose on not. I'd say around 80% of people who skip bail are eventually caught. A life with an active arrest order on your head is not a real life - but then again, a life after a felony is not really a life neither.
Yeah, I'll be the first to admit it's not perfect, but I like the story and experience so much I had to recommend it.

The claims Pinker made. That violence is decreasing over time throughout the entire world. That is a very broad claim and I feel that the evidence he presented did not support it.

You don't get it, it's my *doctor* who told me this...then I've read in the popular press as well since then.  I mean, "Everyone knows" Jesus is exists and loves you in spite of his sins....oh wait, /r/atheism doesn't.  I'm going to stop talking to you, as I can tell you've deeply ingrained this in your personalty to make sure you get your ass to the gym,  and I honestly think you'll do better having those beneficial effects to you blood pressure which you might not get if I actually do convince you.

 Punished for draconian drugs laws? Just because there are laws doesn't mean it's right to have that law in existance. Also debt to society is a very iffy and overused phrase. Why does he owe anything to society? From what I can tell he broke some heavy drug laws, and was going to be sentenced.

Heh. Let's crunch some numbers. (According to this article.)[http://arizona-travel.suite101.com/article.cfm/grand_canyon_skywalk_first_year] The skywalk is averaging 2000 tourists a day.  Let's say they're open for 300 days a year (holidays, bad weather, repairs, upgrades)  $40 bucks for the park $30 bucks for the skywalk  300x2000x70=$42,000,000   Now, let's be conservative and say that only half the visitors pony up for the photo.   1000x30x300=$9,000,000  All told, that's $51 million dollars, roughly with some fudging and guessing.   Now, obvious there are people to pay, maintenance, inspections, overhead and all that. But remember that taxes on tribal ventures are lower and that many of the employees are Tribal members themselves, who also benefit from the communal monies.   Pony up White Man. Pony up.  
Did you have anyone else backing your loan? It seems not smart for the bondsman to loan so much money to a foreigner.

Oh, I thought you were on a boat or something. I posted just now about losing one of the lenses of my glasses in a water park swimming pool. I can't believe I found it, considering that water and glass have very similar refraction indices (~.2 difference, while water and air is ~.35 and glass and air is ~.5), and I was looking while not wearing glasses, so I couldn't see anything.
Have you ever seen a man eat his own head?
Yep, i did. We had a very good time, and the people there were very cool. I even left my cellphone in the pocket of my vest and they sent it to me via priority mail.   The hardest part is getting back up the river. It's pitch black, and you're in a little 10ft canoe paddling like hell while trying to stay out of the way of 25ft cabin cruisers. Other than that, I had a great time :-) 
why are your icons so small?
NEVER!!! I'll keep my books, and you kids keep your newfangled technology!
If they're unfertilized, that means they're being kept away from roosters and being prevented from engaging in an important natural behavior (mating). I think consent applies.
&gt;you should use the bathroom of whatever gender you're dressed as.   This brings me back to the potential problem of "cheaters," which can really fuck things up for actual trans-people.   It's too bad this is such a difficult subject.

Yeah, the first thing I did when I finished is look up details of how it was made. Those 30 minutes as he goes through "The Rectum" are absolutely amazing and so captivating. Really really unsettling.  I'd love to catch a cinema screening at some point and then take some people to shock them (and talk to them about it afterwards).
So if you were in the same situation and had the chance to be free again, what would you do then? 
also i went through all of your pages and downvoted everything youv said for the past 2 months or so, which was about 6 pages, i got bored, but you're really really faggy, reddit troll vagface
Funny, we have fluffy clouds like that here too...
Well, in their defense, if it's okay for a young boy to emulate machismo, there really isn't anything wrong with young girls pretending to be their gender's counterpart to that.  I'm not saying it didn't make me furrow my brow, but morally...eh, whatever.

I dunno, I work in finance and I've never seen a single actual banker or trader wearing a digital watch.   I think Geither/Paulson do this to try to seem more "common man" instead of rich mofo.
Why would you want to use credit cards for everyday purchases? Isn't bank cards used? I mean, the only rational reason to use a credit card is if you really need to buy something that you can't afford at the moment. For everything else, paying money to be able to spend money would just be stupid.
Looks like a few people need to replace their sarcasm detector. 
&gt;Otherwise, he'd have to find a job that meets his skill set.  We are under the assumption that there is no minimum wage, and that any job that this man can find, does not pay enough for him to be able to support himself. What happens then?
I find this solution woefully inadequate.  edit: okay, that was much too strong; you are correct that this approach works.  I just long for something better.

***Nine days later**, *after blood samples sent to Paris for analysis showed signs of poison, Hamas announced his death and blamed Mossad*  Of course you will have conflicting theories until autopsy results come in.
And black people. Should we bar them from donating blood, too?
Apologies, point taken
Actually it kinda was. Because it is reversed, and although that superficially gives you a 'happy ending' the lingering of what you know this will turn into prevents it from being 'reversible'.  You should watch it, great film.
It's not so much that i missed it, seeing as how i was born in 1987 and dont really have any clear memories of the 80's, and more specifically, my parents were not out of there minds and realized the only place for a young kid to be seeing movies was at the home...on VHS, so, essentially short circuit, in my mind is one hundred percent 90's...its also not the end of the world that we dont see eye to eye.
...King Arthur.
Speak for yourself. Some of us are :P 
I like dark humor fine, I guess I just don't like slapstick or physical comedy very much. Sure, I found some parts of Braindead funny, and the sheer amount of blood they used in that movie is comical, but I guess I feel like I'm not enjoying this as much as I'm "supposed" to? Maybe I should start smoking weed again...
I'm sorry that I ever doubted you.
I find dark screens with light/white text to be brutal on my eyes. I can only read for small amounts of time before I have to switch to another site.   
the more of us the better
that's pretty depressing
Could you elaborate on 'pets'?
Don't forget that against Truman's orders MacArthur made public threats of nuclear strikes on China. At this time China had an anti-nuke policy, but after these threats they asked the Soviets if they would counter attack the US with their nukes if it really happened, and when the Soviets said no they reversed that policy and began building their own nuclear arsenal.
damn!  I'm sorry!
I did it in LMMS. Everything but the guitar tracks are samples or VSTs. The Nintendo synth is LMMS's Gameboy plugin. I started out writing music in MOD trackers, so I guess it's just my style.
Nice pic, is it available online?
I understand that this is a gray area concerning ownership.  I don't consider it stealing because it's something they're happy to give away for free (they distribute them on sidewalks, in schools, to military members, etc.).  I'm not taking away from anyone's livelihood, although it could be argued that it costs them a nominal amount more because of increased demand beyond those who are seriously trying to read the bible.  It's like taking a free sample in the grocery store but throwing it in the trash instead of eating it.  Except the grocery store isn't spreading ridiculous statements and stifling progress by encouraging individuals to trade reason for faith.  Edit:  Changed "trying to stifle" to "stifling".  I doubt the Gideons are actively trying to stifle progress, but they are doing so regardless of whether they're aware of it or not.
This is such an ignorALL GLORY TO THE HYPNOBROAD
To be pretentious is to be "characterized by assumption of dignity or importance." The word doesn't apply to someone who is *actually* dignified and important. There are many ways to insult the most powerful man in the world, but to call him pretentious just doesn't make sense. It's like trying to insult Einstein by calling him a "know-it-all."
Oooops. Sorry for making you clean up the messes.

Then they become actual publishers, no? The difference between a publisher and a "vanity press" lies in being discriminating about what you publish, and about the editing. If they hire editors, I think they need to become discriminating -- because they simply couldn't edit all of it.
You can, but it is unofficial and open to scams.  Sometimes you will see someone in Trade saying "WTT Gametime for gold, I think its about 1.5kg or thereabouts for a month" 
It's not that we don't see eye to eye, it's that the OP was asking for 90's movies, and your example was from the 80's.  The ability to admit you were wrong will serve you well in life.

Well toastyghost, if you're going to write a movie about the chess game, you should know the whole story. [Here it is](http://www.jmooneyham.com/heartbreaker-shadowfast-supercar.html).  (I'm one of the oldest redditors, and so had time enough to write quite a bit on my memoirs).
is that a /b/ folder?
Just a thought---If you want people to read your post you might want to put it in the language subreddit the post is written in. If you post it to the main reddit it will never get viewed and commented on because most of us don't speak Arabic.
This is not about me. The next time I want to be asked questions I will do an AMA, trust me.
:D Awesome.  Just send me a pm, we will work out the details.
I was going to post here and call you a big fat liar and then point out some benchmarks that supported my claims... but I'm having problems find some.  I should take a look into Lua.  The only thing I can really argue is from a memory usage point of view, but that's not really the argument here.
&gt;Correct - so is the problem private companies (by definitions, organizations of people created by voluntary arrangement to provide goods), or government (by definition, organizations of people who use coercion to enforce regulations and collect money)?  Private companies are organizations of people created by voluntary arrangement to *collect money*. Providing goods is irrelevant to most US companies, and they only do it if they have to. If they can find an alternate means of collecting money, they do so.  Government does not exist to collect money. It exists to see that the goals set by those who hold power are achieved. In a democratic society, these goals would be those of the public at large. Collecting money is a means of achieving those goals.  Furthermore, you assume that *both* can't be the problem. Large private companies are able to buy influence with the government to use its power for their own ends.

Actually, I don't know... I guess his responses are always money-related.  And I insist that it really doesn't have to do with money.  6 months, not a single flower from the ground even.  6 months, not a single date that he planned on his own.  He just really doesn't try, and if he does, he doesn't try hard enough.  And the sad part is, it's so simple, so easy and effortless, and I treat him like gold.

The different models differ by one EU size. One of my pairs is a 43, the other 42. You might need to try a different model. I have the KSO and the Sprint. The Sprint is larger by design.  Your feet are probably not exactly identical in terms of size. I say accommodate the larger one, but if it's really dramatic, you might have to shell out for two pairs of different sizes.  I thought my first pair might be too tight. Turns out I just needed to keep my toenails short, and the shoes will stretch just a little tiny bit. My other pair is slightly larger and there is more room, but they aren't loose on my feet. The extra room doesn't cause any problems for me.

Wow. Thanks for calling me "white man", and telling me to "Pony up". Seriously, what the hell is wrong with you, why would you antagonize someone personally?  I like your numbers. They're correct and interesting. Your post would have been cool if you had kept it respectful.  Also, note how all I did was state that the tribe could have used their money to preserve wild lands. You didn't actually respond to what I said. I have to ask, after the tribe sets up their skywalk, and makes all this money, what are they going to spend it on? McDonalds? Hollywood movies? 
Most ovens of recent vintage, maybe.  But the thing is, the clean cycle operates at something like 900 F.  Non-clean temps max out at 500 or 550.   And that won't burn off the gunk.    If the OP doesn't have a self-clean oven available, which seems to be the case, he/she can use a product called _Dawn Power Dissolver_.  Stuff is great - I use it clean the brown, baked / cooked on grease from the bottom and sides of my All-Clad stainless pans.   The only bad thing about it is the only place around here that stocks it is Wal-Mart.  (It's pretty much the only reason I ever go to Wal-Mart).

&gt; The word doesn't apply to someone who is actually dignified and important  Self-important maybe.   &gt; There are many ways to insult the most powerful man in the world  While I concede that he is by any measure one of the most powerful men in the world, how does that confer importance or dignity? Only if he's a tyrant is his power important to me, but if he uses power tyrannically... he has no human dignity worth speaking of. And how can one have any real dignity when the only reason people treat you as important is that you are powerful?  I mean, I understand that you're just a monkey. Monkeys worship the alpha male. I get that. But aren't you even just a little self-aware of this?

It does say "must", which means that if the condition is not present, then the resulting situation cannot follow, at least according to common usage.

Actually, it's not. On average, the president sees a very slight (less than one percent) drop in his poll numbers after the SOTU. [cite](http://www.gallup.com/poll/125396/President-Support-Usually-Unaffected-State-Union.aspx)
Interesting point, makes perfect sense that this would have evolved from text on paper.  Yet books and newspapers to me don't come off quite as luminous.
Yeah, sure, to my way of thinking anything having to do with reality, has to do with physics, science, in general. Again, I was simply ruminating, you know thinking, 'what if' thoughts...as a scientist, I assume, you must do this too. And, it's always nice to have someone knowledgeable, even semi-knowledgeable, to talk with. Regarding your questions, I admit to being somewhat offended that my initiative to post here, offended, YOU. Thus, I really didn't pay attention to your questions. I was not trolling or anything like that, or if I was it was for a decent conversation, I am so sorry your thinking is so rigid.
Yup I turned off my icons.   My desktop is a completely different beast with them on hence I just hide them, best way to keep everything tidy with minimal work.

One of the rules was that no cameras were allowed.  I remember once the owner saw someone with a camera, took it from them and threw it in the pool.
Yup. (I remember the girl)  I admit, in her case, it was somewhat more reasonable for people to get concerned- but still ridiculous. As a hacker/electronic hobbyist, it just seems so ignorant to me that people are technologically illiterate. That everyone has a cellphone on them at all times, but the site of a battery and some wires is a red flag.
Wow, you like torturing animals eh? That is a brave thing to admit to on Reddit, and just generally a piece of shit thing to do. You should be proud of yourself.

So you created the thread and you don't understand the rules of it?  Maybe you should have asked: if you were a kid in the 90's, what was your favorite movie.  The way you worded it, it seemed like you wanted a kids movie made in the 90's that you enjoyed.  Try to be clearer next time.

If the church doesn't break up marriages you may be fine for now.  But what do they do with kids?  It would be child abuse for you to raise your kids mormon now that you know it is a lie.  And I find it hard to believe the church will side with a marriage over every issue.  Any time you cross the church they are going to tell her to leave you.  And what about the tithe?  Did you stop paying?  It would be terrible to pay money to the church when that money can be used for your family.

I believe there was a video report by Doctors Luigi and Mario on this phenomenon. A bit unconventional, and their hypothesis was somewhat unclear, but very useful to our understanding of parallel dimensions.
Shhhhh...
It is a dilemma, but a dilemma that simply must be accepted and dealt with.  I would say that if you feel comfortable enough to go out in public appearing as whatever gender you are trying to appear, then you shouldn't have any problems using the bathroom that people looking at you on the sidewalk would expect you to walk into. Just be discreet and don't attract unnecessary attention. Just blend in and walk around like you own the place, as if everything's normal. If you're all shifty eyed and nervous when you go to the bathroom, then people will pick up on those nonverbal cues and be suspicious.

Why would the judge care, they don't have anything to gain by those people going or not going to prison.  And they often don't even get to make the decision.
So, did ya checker out first?
It's totally true. The only way you can get a law enforced is to have good connections with the police - better connections than the person you want the law enforced against. And even then if it's against a company, organisation or group, you'll still have no chance as they'll all run around calling assorted connections and relatives to exert pressure from all sides.  The level of corruption is so profound, it influences a lot of life. It's not a matter of having to pay the occasional bribe, it's more about doing all you can to avoid any conflict and the ill will that such conflict could rain down upon you. It's really hard for us westerners to imagine just how corrupt things are here; it's a real trip down the rabbit-hole.

You have that backwards, its Peggle that is played by stay at home moms who are glad that all they need to know is to hit the orange pegs and you do it by moving the mouse. Halo is the one that requires at least some thought as to which gun is best to use and when and what routes to take to the flag and so on.  Seriously, you are one hell of a biased and elitist gamer if you are making such ridiculous statements, you could have at least had some credibility if you didn't claim that Peggle is less casual than Halo

Ah, I see where you're coming from now. I interpreted "must" not to mean if and only if, but I interpreted it as a softer must - such as in "must reading" = required/highly recommended reading.  I guess Stalin wasn't religious per se, but he did tout an ideology - he pressed on a greater idea that was (as he convinced) noble enough for sacrifice.

Yes, but that's rather different.  The proof of 1+1=2 is trivial if you model the natural numbers in Peano's Arithmetic. Whitehead and Russell's developed in proved it using formal logic.  I agree that this is something even almost all math Ph.Ds would not have to worry about. Verifying that the statement 1+1=2 for some formal logic model where 1,+,=, and 2 have been properly defined is not a very valuable result. Nobody is going to get a Ph.D by extending the work of Whitehead and Russell.  However, since random processes and probabilistic methods have proven to be valuable in economic models, including several nobel prizes, I'd hope an economics researcher would have a basic understanding of probability.  
For every thread in agreement, there's a thread in disagreement.

Why can't you leave the US out of it?  It's so boring and obvious and condescending that anytime an article on Reddit is even remotely or potentially critical of another country, some American jackass has to pipe up with how the US does it too or is worse in some comparable way.  Fuck off, OK.  If there ever was any validity to hijacking a thread to point out that the US does it too, you've completely ruined it by being so incredibly boring and predictable.     
No, I don't. I sit in front of my TV caring about which celebrities have drug problems. Srry.

I laughed out loud (in the supermarket queue: people stared) when I read the comment about Macmillan having a "monopoly" on the books they publish ... especially given the terms Amazon intend to impose on Kindle books. From [Charles Stross' blog](http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/2010/01/amazon-macmillan-an-outsiders.html):  &gt;you have to agree that Amazon is a publisher, license your rights to Amazon to publish through the Kindle platform, guarantee that you will not allow other ebook editions to sell for less than the Kindle price, and let Amazon set that price, with a ceiling of $9.99. In other words, Amazon choose how much to pay you, while using your books to undercut any possible rivals (including the paper editions you still sell).
No shit, I came here to see if this was at the top and I'm shocked that it's not. Are there no waitresses/waiters on reddit? I've never heard anyone with any experience (of any race) disagree with this.

Ah I didn't read it that way at first.  I don't see how putting someone in prison would help with this.  I could actually see the exact opposite.  If they kept the right person out of jail.
It would be nice if you could find a line that "attacks all opponents of prorogation as being ill-informed and ignorant." This is just a straw-man argument. She just doesn't say that.   When did I dismiss your views? I disagreed with them and, using evidence from the article and the official site of the Parliament of Canada, challenged them. In fact the sheer volume of characters I dedicated to my endeavor illustrates that I did exactly the opposite of that which I am being accused.     It is you who seems to be ignoring most things I say. It seems your only intent is to get the last word. (I'll oblige if you don't try to insult me in your last post.)  What game are we playing? If it is read and discuss, and you don't read then I guess you are refusing to play my game. Touche.

I do miss it. But I also know it'd be hard on me to drive it now, at my age. The suspension was that of a race car, so you felt every imperfection in the road. It also had no air conditioning, and its flat black paint made it hot as hell on summer days in Texas. It also had no heater in the winter time, after a certain point (stripped out partly for weight reduction purposes). Brrrr!   I wish I had more photos of it now. Specifically the interior, under the hood, inside the trunk, and underneath the tail. But taking photos was relatively expensive back then, and I was poor. Plus, I actively avoided photos so that there'd be less available imagery for the police to use against me. So there's only three pics today that I've been able to track down-- and they're not very good ones. A friend took two, and I think my dad took the third.
That's about right.

I wonder why they never did a Highlander sequel.  I mean, other than the fact they kind of wrapped the whole thing up in the one.  They could have done a prequel, or followed some other immortal.

Or, if you are too lazy, or not inclined, to take matters into your own hands, let fuckheads like those in the picture run the show. It's really up to you.

I apologize, everyone loves being judged by people they have never met, talked to, or even knew existed at all. I'm not showing her *all* of reddit, only this submission. Although you're the last person on Earth I need to explain myself to; I keep *very* close tabs on what my children are viewing on the Internet, and employ various methods of content filtering across all levels of my home network.    With all due respect to your "opinion" there *is* a downvote button on every submission. I suggest that if you disagree, or dislike a submission, rather than making personally judgmental commentary  and subsequently whining about the negative response to it, you use the appropriate button and move on. 
I read somewhere that Australia has 9 out of the top ten poisonous spiders in the world, the top 9, actually. Huntsman aren't particularly poisonous, but their bite does hurt. And they run fuckin fast, believe me. Thing is, with all the spiders and such, you rarely hear of anyone dying, or even getting sick. Funnel webs are only really a problem in Sydney and environs, not so much up here in Bris, you get used to it after a while. Still, as an avowed arachnaphobe, I'm really glad when summer is over and the creepy crawlies go somewhere else!

I'm Canadian. We have fairly significant social programs and subsidy programs and had one of the best outcomes in the developed world after the collapse. Toronto is already pushing for green roofs, and it's estimated that 10% of Germany's roofs are green. You call me authoritarian, I say you are influenced out of positions that are for your best interest by corporations. Look at your lobbyists and reckless corporate culture for the source of your woes. 
Why is that "too bad?"  That sounds like great news for the NFL and no news for the Champions League.  As stated by notlob, with the UCL final moved to Saturday, their numbers are likely to increase as well.

My wife also doesn't like 69ing. She says it's the worst of both worlds because either you are paying attention to what is happening to you and are giving crappy head, or are giving good head but aren't paying attention to what is being done. I now agree with her.

If you're paying for a plan, then those phone calls are not free. They just don't charge extra for that service (or at least, they say they don't, and that the other things are slightly more expensive than they truly are).

Yeah that whole comment was sarcasm free. While I personally do not agree with the war in Afghanistan, I do support the men and women that have risked their lives to keep other people safe. Yes the whole thing is a quagmire and far too many people have been killed thusfar, but the sacrifice that the individuals have made needs to be recognised none the less.

But we get all this from dialogue and conjecture.  We can't actually play through the events, which you should be able to.  Those were just some of the immediate questions.  There could have been more, like brokering a deal with the batarians, hunting down people who have dealt with Collectors before, finding slavers, more failed research teams, etc.  The Reaper corpse had to be recent because it had the cuttlefish profile shared by the current generation of Reapers.  It begs another question:  How the fuck did they find this thing?

Yeah the hacking/bypassing either needs to be turned into an actual challenge or just done away with.  As it currently stands it is only a waste of time.  As far as the lack of sidequests, I kind of liked and disliked it.  On the one hand why the hell would al Spectre get involved in deciding if someone should get gene therapy for their kid or not?  On the other hand, side quests that actually have some sort of significance help expand and flesh out the universe.
No, but I did let a few rich old men take me to dinner = )
Prosecutor wants a conviction.  Problem is, defendant is demonstrably innocent and he'll lose.  If the defense lawyer then sells his client out by recommending that he take a shitty plea bargain, the prosecutor owes him a big favor.  Maybe cashed in when his nephew gets a DUI, or when he's up for Judge.  Favors are handy things to have.
you can grow oyster mushrooms no problem in a collapse type situation.  dehydrated they're ~30% protein.  they're extra great because you dont need a lot of light to grow them.  you could even do it underground as long as you can provide a small amount of light a few hours a day.  button mushrooms you can grow in complete darkness.  hows that for a convenient and hide-able food growing operation.  fyi button and portabello (same species i think.. or very close) should always be cooked before eating or they're semi toxic.

Napoleon was not a tyrant in the context of post revolutionary France.  Compared to what French people dealt with before and in the immediate aftermath of the Revolution, Napoleon was a massive improvement.  It is misrepresenting that agreement to suggest it was to make Napoleon seem to be god fearing or pious. It was just to appease catholics who had been oppressed during the Revolution.  He was not crowned by the pope, and did not recognize Catholicism as the state religion.  The deal that was struck was hardly favorable to the Church, and no Catholic could seriously consider Napoleon a pious man as a result.
Damn it, I actually thought about it, and still typed it wrong.
I've heard this, could you direct me to some links with more information about how it is all a scam, I can't seem to find any.
I think it is more that the agencies that regulate curriculum kill creativity than the actual schools themselves. When I was in school, our teachers were allowed creative teaching and we learned a lot. Now, we're not allowed so much to be creative with teaching. In Texas, it's the TEA and the TAKS test. Just ignore the evidence that art and music education improve test scores. What really improves test scores is drilling and rote memorization of dry facts!  It's not the schools. It's what governments make schools do.
I think he meant when not moving forward up a hill.  When stopped on a hill  (because of a stop light,etc), some of us were taught to hold the brake and apply the gas until it was revved up enough to go up the hill so the car wouldn't fall backward and then let go of the brake.   You couldn't do that w/ a newish BMW if the description is correct.

We used to have the [Fairness Doctrine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fairness_Doctrine) until Reagan got rid of it. Then they effectivly  cut support for public education to keep the voters ignorant. A brilliant plan to advance their fascist agenda.

They could've done a miniseries or tv show to expand the story, at least. Oh well.
Actually, I had my computer open because he kept asking me questions like "is this a true story?", "what have we seen that guy in?" and -- at the end, when one of the actors quoted a line of scripture that he wanted on his epitaph -- "what did he say?"  The film was *Breaker Morant.*  Two thumbs up.  I'd seen it before and he hadn't, so I was glad to be able to answer questions on the spot.  Still, I think it's a MAJOR DRAG when someone posts a link without any warning that there's going to be audio whether you like it or not.
I was questioning why kclicquot thought a mac could not be a laptop. My macbook pro looks like a laptop to me.
I have no experience doing yoga so I can't really say if it's better or worse than gymnastics stretching.  For gymnastics we do a lot of assisted stretches. An example of that is when you see someone sitting on the floor, legs straight in front of them reaching for their toes and someone is behind them pressing gently on their back.  Another thing would be over-splits where you do the splits with your feet on two blocks, so that you can go past the 180 degree split between your legs.  I think whatever you do you should focus on form and consistency. You won't need a person assisting you until you can go as far as possible without feeling a hard stretch. You should be trying to do the stretches every day and focus on form like keeping your knees from bending on a hamstring stretch.
I was a little modest at the time, so I didn't really want to be topless.  I did feel a little strange being one of the only clothes people around.  It was even stranger when one of my co-workers had a day off (or 5 minutes after their shift ended) and they were hanging out literally.
I don't see how that would happen in humans. I suppose any possible "super fucked up beasts" would be a product of nurture, not nature.

I am not offended.  I am perfectly willing to have a conversation about the nature of reality, consciousness or the role of the observer in physics.  What I will not do, however, is pretend that it's a conversation about physics simply because there is an overlap of language-- using the terms 'quantum,' 'entanglement,' 'higher dimensions' and 'consciousness' does not _make_ this a scientific question.  Anyway, I _have_ asked some questions about your thoughts, which should be interpreted as a sign that I _am_ willing to have a conversation about this.  Answering my questions is an opportunity to explain your thoughts and engage the conversation you were looking for.  
A month or two after that, and the street my company is on was roped off. Another bomb scare. I just walked up to the yellow tape, and politely asked a cop if I could get to my job. He waved me on, no problem. Apparently someone had wired a TV's power cable into a streetlight.  That's the most suspicious thing I've experienced, and even so, I can't imagine roping off a city block as a result.

I live in Australia. My grandmother had roosters and hens on her farm, we ate their eggs quite a bit when I was growing up. They were never harmed, or mistreated. Instead they were loved. I have many friends in similar situations.  My father lives in Vietnam, and there again have been similar situations. Sure, there are not always humane situations, but you cannot ignore that there can be a symbiotic relationship.  Small communities avoid the need for transporting over large distances, and of operating with profit as the number one priority. They allow the owners to form bonds with their pets. Large scale is what causes so much of the mistreatment and environmental damage.

I haven't seen anything that hollywood or disney had made to be historical accurate. Today Greek mythology is mostly located during the classical Greece while the stories before that which were the original inspiration for clasical Greece tales and the stories that came after classical Greece are totally neglected. Roman people were slowly transformed to Italian,French, Spanish etc. As for Rome taking all it's culture from Greece is not entire true as there was a common Greco-Roman period that had cultural infuence from Rome, Greece and other parts of the empire most of them eastern. That was until they split to Western and Eastern Roman Empire and all of these are left out from modern stories. Disney is messing all these up into one story showing legends from different time periods into one story. Taking a very good story and making it hollywood size is just wrong.
It's possible, but it seems like those would be the guys that also can't talk maturely about their feelings and desires, and aren't looking for a relationship. If you're developing strong feelings for someone and want them to be returned in the form of a relationship, it seems like that would be useful knowledge to gain.

In the ESL classroom, I tend to be very friendly and not very strict.  My students respond well to this and work for me not out of fear of my anger if they don't, but more out of an aversion to disappointing me, I believe.  I think I'm somehow going to have to cultivate a sterner demeanor in the classroom, while still being friendly.

Keywords are the only way to do it.  Adding comments to searching does not help find a link.  Remember what reddit is.  Links.  Search should help you find a link you want to find.  If you want comment searching use google.  But if reddit were to start doing that, it would be separate of the normal search.  Because reddit is a link aggregator.  Search should help you find those links.  Currently searching titles doesn't do a whole lot to find links that relate to certain things.

I don't really understand your question. This is a picture of a reddit alien that my daughter drew and wanted me to post on reddit. I don't see how this could be in anyway confusing, but I could be wrong. Does the title not effectively explain the submission?
Civ IV, Cowboy Bebop, Cosmos, Red Dwarf, Project 64.  Drool
I didn't mean that he was a tyrant in that he was oppressive. Obviously he led to good change in government.   The "illegal treatment" could refer to Catholics against a non-Catholic man as emperor, and also the royalists (many of them Catholic) thinking that his rule was illegal. By getting the side of religion (the pope), he was able to appease them and legitimize his rule from detractors.  The "illegal treatment" does not refer to oppression, but his legitimacy to the crown.
Oh, you were trying to educate *fools*?  Carry on.
Giggity
shorter answer: because it's _the_ Sun.
Thank you very much.  I haven't had the time or the resources to continue working on what I currently have in-progress and it has been killing me. I am hoping that I will be able to pick things back up very soon.
Haha, I'm not going to put a picture of myself up on the internet.
Even AOE throw on its own is incredibly useful.  It makes fighting through husks and abominations a breeze.
I assume you're trolling on this tread as I was.  Very witty!!  You win the troll war here, my friend.  You played it much closer to the chest.. Mine was just too over the top.  
I would say there was, but there were never any fights over it or anything.  I think they pretty much just left the issues alone, or addressed them at board meetings.  I think they had a little respect for each other because of their common beliefs even if they didn't agree with some aspects of their lifestyles.   I think that most people that were there were at least bi sexual because so many of them were swingers.  The only people they didn't really accept were Trans-genders.  A few Trans-gender men came to the resort once, and they were not well received.  On the other hand there was a cross dressing guy that was there all the time, and everyone loved him.
Thanks, that's definitely good advice.  Both things I ought to be able to handle.
Well thank you again.  
Stylish is great. I just wish they had more screenshots to compare. I use it and a bookmarklet called [Darken](http://lifehacker.com/259456/invert-web-page-colors-with-the-darken-bookmarklet) to change any website to a darker version.
That's an awfully big assumption.  You can't know the details of Mike Connell's situation regarding Ohio.

What other submission?
Give the science NOW!
Hmmm I was hoping it wouldn't come to that because I have a few computers that play steam games.
She says he is an asshole. He physically abused her and took her kid away through the court system and hiring "expert" witnesses to lie for him.
and cocky about enforcing the rules no doubt.
I dunno, the dude was sort of a prick about it too...
Even those who knew him as a University student mention that he had a dignified air. I said nothing of it being conferred by his job.  And whether or not *you* (whoever you may be) consider him important is irrelevant. It's odd to even have to argue this point, but every American president in the past 75 years has determined, to some extent, the course of human civilization, and if that doesn't smack of importance, then nothing does, and no-one is important.  It occurs to me, though, that you're probably just practising your debating skills, and don't really believe most of what you're writing. If so, try to go easy on the *ad hominem*; it's too blatant, and doesn't score you many points.
You. Are. Fascinating. I kinda wish you'd do a whole AMA about "I was sexually awakened at 9 but I don't consider it abuse."  I had gobs of sexual feeling from the time I was eight (girl here too) but I think if any adult had tried to help me with them I would have been really sad and messed up and shamed and scared. I was MEANT to just curl up in bed at night and pretend I got to touch Mr. Spock's penis. (Weird..sure. I'm a redditor aren't I?)   And if you ARE troll, huzzah to you fine sir...tis a mighty thread. 
Very cool indeed.

17, and none. :(
Here is how BIIARU replied, in my mind:   &gt;It's true! My mind races when I attempt to fall asleep. I can't get it too stop! edit: Like the time I went hiking up a mountain with my six sexiest friends, and two kids! We ran out of food on the first day, and instead of going back to our truck (about 100m away), we decided to start eating the youngest, and healthiest first. My youngest son was quite tasty, but my daughter tasted pretty bad (like it was rotten, or something.) All I can think about is: What would I taste like? And "Damn, the girl would have tasted better if we didn't chase her down, or use the truck to run her over!"
Do you have a valid credit card and lack common sense? I think we could make an exception...
Nah seriously some dogs get majorly retarded by it. It's true.  My aunty had to have a few put down 'cause of it :)
Electroshock therapy.
a cat o'9 at a party, it got a little out of hand. There was quite a bit of blood, and a stained carpet.  By top was pisses about what happened and was really angry at the guy who did it, I thought it was awesome. I miss the marks.
mushroom cultivation is a good thing. however, do **NOT** eat mushrooms from the wild, that you do not know/ cannot identify. 90% of all mushrooms are poisonous, and while they are good for you, the nutritional value is less than that of plants, fruit, insects, nuts and animals. 
&gt; That argument is an irrelevant distraction. Some guy in a shack in Wyoming being unable to get fast internet has no relevance to the fact that major cities are languishing.  Do you want to be the elected official that has to explain why Big-D democratically powerful urban areas are getting kick-ass broadband while right-leaning rural areas are getting the shaft?  I think in this case market forces prevail.
Yeah, it's more of a "funny, I didn't think Fred Phelps would actually bleed, let alone *blood*" sort of funny.

Have you looked at CLISP or Clozure? Outside of threading support (admittedly, a huge thing), SBCL works well on Windows.  That asked, I'm paying for a LispWorks Pro Windows license soon because I can't waste any more time fighting with various libraries/thread support.
I notice a lot of white people seem to be very bashful about even the acknowledgment of cultural/racial differences. White people are often scared to even use to word 'black' in social settings for some reason. I feel that recognizing or talking about people who are in interracial relationships carry the same stigma for most whites.  
Since he's so powerful, that's all it would be would be: him fucking things up. In order to give him a challenge, they would have to just throw hundreds or thousands of agents at him at once. It would look really cool but wouldn't make the movie good.
Haha it's 12:33 pm here. I'm an aussie :)
Thanks, but I really would love you to say what they can reflash it with if they don't know what is causing the bug.  The firmware for a toaster?
Oh yes.  The illustrations were terrifying.  Actually, I dug those books out a while ago.... yep, just found them, I've got three!  Gonna read them tonight... ha!
There is no pillow softer than a clear conscience. BIIARU, you have done some crazy shit in your life (note to self: amend previous post to show crazy shit.), that's why you can't sleep. You have regrets, or you've a guilty conscience. Let go of your past, BIIARU, live free!
Do you mind pointing out the flaws or omissions? 
To determine the toughest one I'll first have to pit them against each other in keyboard sword fights and monitor-hurling competitions.
While I wasn't necessarily referring to intelligence per se, there is actually quite a bit of research on that subject:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_and_intelligence

I see you go with "mash my hand on the keyboard" naming conventions.
If that was your goal, I think you hit the nail on the head.
I'm fairly certain its totaled.  He clipped me right in front of the tire, and I think the steel bumper twisted the frame when it got sheared off.  The drivers side fender is warped, my door doesn't open all the way, and the hump in the floor moved so I can barely press down the accelerator now.  I regret not having the 3rd car stick around to possibly id the driver though.  They didn't witness the accident itself so I didn't ask them to stay.
I just love the skin tone, facial features, body type, and, being that most asians are either buddhist or atheist that fits well with my belief system (or lack there of)
I'm not sleeping tonight...
In that case Debian running XMonad.  The little bar at the top is a program called dzen.  Without that it's just a black screen.  When I'm using a workspace it'll look like [this](http://i.imgur.com/t8CQ2.png).  That's an older shot without the bar at the top though.  I added the bar so I could see what workspace I was currently on and what workspaces had windows open.
Bullshit.  Socialism has not been vilified *enough.*

Of course he was a fucking douche.  You actually think he may have just been misunderstood?!  Fucking hell.
Same. Admittedly, though, the first time I wandered into a necromancer cave it was pretty creepy. And then I went to another one and realized they were all exactly the same.
My friend really wants to join but no one has given him any advice on what to do , to fix his credit. It would seem logical that getting a job and paying it back/making arrangements would seem more sensible than just filing for bankruptcy.   Morally, he doesn't want to sue his parents, they have no money it wouldn't do him any good
Actually, it's not hard to sterilize a carb cake for the spores to colonize.  It takes a little prep work, some enclosed room, and a source of heat suitable for cooking.  The important part is maintaining the sterile environment until the colony has a chance to completely take over the cake.
Most of the offers now involve them running a credit check, or something else the precludes using a throwaway card. They're onto us.  
Oh yeah that's another :)
I only know of one type of person that anonymously asks for pictures of six-year-old girls over the Internet. I don't think I'll be sending you any pictures.

Note how my above comment does not have a star.   Now click on the comma.   (I still upmodded you though.)
Man, I miss RuSan's. I'm in Florida, but I grew up in Atlanta and have family there. I might just try to coincide a visit, if this gets off the ground.
Would that be 5 of a kind?  Still seems like it might be 4 of a kind to me.
That is a very random list. What was the purpose of the animal shows, line dancing, Karaoke? Was this therapy or recreation?
Ridiculous. 
It can be both. Have an upvote!
You are not entirely racist, just a moron.
Yes to both. She remembers one patient who would call the nurses mommy, and they would sedate the lady for it.

The Lynch extended version is my favorite movie ever. 
Yepp, don't get me wrong, I totally appreciate your effort in making in and stand by your point.
Which song do you mean? I'm assuming you mean the radio edit of Gravity. We've had absolutely no luck getting on radio. Nearly everyone says our songs are too long. Thanks for the input! Feel free to pass these mp3s along to anyone. 
Pirated Windows. You can get Win7Pro 64bit for just about [$65](http://win741.com/ "before 1/5 it was $29") and all you need is a \*.edu address. Hell, somehow I managed to find a phone number and 2 got full copies (not upgrade) because I "couldn't access my school's email account at the moment" and had them cc my gmail account. The third copy* (the one I actually did completely online) is actually an upgrade.  *note: I actually do have 3 *.edu email addresses.
Wow that's really nice of you. Was he fairly effected by the recession?

I guess that's true, but 15-30gb files for games would take up space quickly.  Not to mention a high likelihood of the games having issues of know when to read where.  I just don't see this as worth it.  
How is it suspicious? He's going to pretend to put together a PC whilst somebody talks him through it via webcam? Yeah sounds really dodgy..
Is it the erection itself that's frowned upon? or is it displaying it like a trophy? Were the ones getting erections generally looked down at just for getting an erection? Does something similar apply to women getting particularly noticeably wet, as in you can smell it wet?
That is likely the result of inbreeding not the breeds being different.

Sorry: I can't remember his opening. This happened more than 30 years ago, and I've played lots of chess games over my life (99% of them in my youth). I don't think the game lasted more than three hours. It might have even lasted as little as under an hour, but the tension and stakes make it seem longer in recollection than it was. He wasn't a bad player. He apparently had quite a few games under his own belt. Hence, his desire to play: he thought he held an advantage.   I was a bit distracted by the fact that any moment we might pitch the table sideways and be trying to kill each other. Whenever I wasn't thinking about the game, I was planning out how I was going to take him in the physical match to come. And I was mentally preparing myself to go all out. Be absolutely barbaric. For that's how you win fights. I did NOT expect the chess game to end things peacefully like it did.

That place is like a prison...
this is a social-based link aggregation site so obviously the comments and ratings are important. if you want to find a website on a particular topic then perhaps you should use google without the site:reddit.com specifier.
&gt;Also, you are projecting. I simply predicted that there would be a group circle jerking about "xtian pretards" (by the way, what part of the definition of bigot requires calls for death?)  . &gt;Oh, I see, when the "LOL they believe in supernatural things, they should be killed." stuff starts (as it always does here)   and then when you defined what kind of bigots you were talking about  &gt;I'm sorry, but I find it perfectly within the definition when people call for the death of those with religious beliefs  Wait what?   &gt;I've been around these parts a little longer than you my friend. If I really thought that reddit en mass was full of bigots, would I spend my time here? Really?  Then specify, don't make open ended comments that seem like they apply to everyone who disagrees with Christianity. If you had waited for an actual example of bigoted commentary, then posted a calm and reasoned rebuttal, you would have done far better.   
Also, unrelated but important... How do you insert linebreaks in your posts? I always hit "enter" to make one, but Reddit doesn't seem to process that and it comes out as a big block of text. Thanks
when i started using ubuntu (and for the most part linux) back during Warty Warthog, i'd install it and log in and was just blown away by how much faster Ubuntu/Gnome was over my WinXP install.  This is no longer the case.  My XP install is a ton faster than Ubuntu.  I wouldn't say the same about an Arch (or gentoo) + *box/twm setup though.  Furthermore, Firefox on linux sucks nuts.  It's getting worse on Windows too, but startup time, browsing speed, javascript speed in linux all suffer greatly.  As does Flash performance.    Office Suite software in Linux is also very slow to load and to perform.  It's not just Ubuntu, or just Gnome or KDE or the Apps it's all of it.  Win7 performs better.
On the contrary, assholes that say socialism has not been vilified enough have not been vilified enough.  
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Phelps  The most intriguing part is that he used to be a civil rights advocate until one day he went crazy in court against a court reporter (which led to his disbarment) and found out that being evil gets shit done and gets attention. I like to think that he's actually the most effective kind of civil rights protester out there because he gladly makes himself the enemy of decency and through the irony of his own displays of intolerance, shows the true nature of hatred that runs deep through humanity and our disdain of happiness and love. He's happy to be the man everyone is allowed to hate.  Or maybe he just went insane.
His name is Robert Paulson.
Hmm. You are giving me an idea...*strokes chin thoughtfully*...
the pain with out sex is a bit unless it is planned or expected pain. Props are expencive so I have several corsets, whips, paddles and a good set of restraints.I also have a collar but it is rarely worn. That is about it. My boyfriend is a Dominant and a bit of a sadist.
Woah, nice MG!
well i think the window manager is [xmonad](http://xmonad.org)
I couldn't tell with the constant references, comments, and stories about Fox News. 
No I'm not. Why is it so wrong to ask questions? How do you know that this isn't the reason for mental illnesses and such? You don't 'cause it hasn't been explored. No such thing as a stupid question :)
The guy was being a perv and he knew it.  I think a lot of people got away with using camera phones.  They did allow cameras for special occasions, but you were only allowed to have them at certain times and you had to make sure you had everyones permission.
!! Ha, it seems to be true!
hahaaa. i got it.
The temperature is the local weather, not that of the CPU.
I (for reasons unknown) read the whole linked article.  They mention turtle self-flipping in it.
^Yes.  Please mount a webcam directly opposite the door, inside the catgloo.  It should photograph the face of any cat that enters, compare it to a database of known cat faces (previous entrants), and assign a name to any new cat.  That way you can automatically send tweets as they enter and depart.  Come to think of it, you'll need a database of cat butts if you want to know when they leave.  Hrm...
We spay and neuter dogs and cats to prevent future harm.... we can't compare that to keeping hen and rooster apart so that humans can enjoy a nutritionally unnecessary product. One is done out of compassion and one is done for human gain.
Yeah, socialists have a habit of living in fantasy land.  Hope you get help!
that's the kinda thing that's awesome, and then you wish someone was around to have witnessed it. hope someone witnessed it. 
I have friends that met on WoW that are married now. Where you meet a person isn't important. The problem here sounds like this chick was just not reliable, the whole "I've never been in a relationship before" thing would set off way more warning flags for me than the fact that it happened on WoW.
You are a hero. Thank you so much.
No. None of the dogs were inbred :)
They make a living off of people not knowing that they're trolling. If there are more articles like this, more people will just laugh at them instead of attacking them.
Nah, they get it all over the place. And I wish people would just stop feeding the trolls. Half the reason they get any attention at all is from people counter protesting. 
Thugs believe in keeping the poor unemployed by limiting the amount of jobs available.  
Insects shouldn't be able to survive in that kind of cold. This isn't good.
i don't think it's that people are pro-whaling.  i think it's more a matter of not forcing your cultural norms onto others.  it would be like telling the rural people in Switzerland to stop making dog jerky and dog sausage when it's a tradition.  yes, there are international limits set on how many and which whales you can kill.  as far as i know, japan abides by it and the demand for whale meat is actually pretty low. 
So what skin should I use?
I'm not sure how to get thickness exactly. Is it more in the low rhythm range that it is missing? What frequencies should I be looking at? Thanks for the praise.
Yeah... I'm sick of the "for science" crap.  I'm gonna masturbate like hell to that.
oh my... so, do you eat it with, or without the maggots? hah
But, uh, since he can just... you know... **FLY AWAY**... slow everything down at will, or destroy an agent by just flying into his chest and exploding them from the inside... how could *multiple* agents pose a serious threat to him at all?
Precisely.
Very affected. The job market in business consulting has taken a huge hit, and it's even worse for a guy in his early 60's. When it comes time to hire, he is last on the list. There is very little consideration for his vast knowledge and experience, unfortunately.  I have no problem helping my dad out. He is a brilliant and warmhearted man, and would do the same for me without a second thought.
no we also have milk in a bag in Quebec
&gt; Regardless of where you stand on the issue, there seem to be some real "skeptic"s on the climate change issue.  There are very, very few of these. The vast majority are exactly what rmuser described.
The same thing straight does: nothing.  It has no effect on your military service.  
Then he dies, just like in a system with a minimum wage. To prevent this you need something like welfare, food stamps or a basic income. Or private charity.
The late-first-century [Didache](http://silouanthompson.net/2008/09/didache/) seems to present it that way:  &gt; [Do not pray like the hypocrites, but rather as the Lord commanded in His Gospel, like this: “Our Father who art in heaven, hallowed be Thy name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done on earth, as it is in heaven. Give us today our daily bread, and forgive us our debt as we also forgive our debtors. And bring us not into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one; for Thine is the power and the glory for ever. **Pray this three times each day.**](http://silouanthompson.net/library/early-church/didache/#fastingprayer)  
While giving them large amounts of extra media coverage and ensuring that millions instead of dozens of people see them. 
...  o_ô
I thought that was a joke, at first.
i wish they'd made the sequel :(
Actually yes you do.. Mac OS will do a good job of not getting fragmented if you are only doing simple little things like surfing the web, moving pictures off your camera, reading emails, etc..  But if you are doing more then that, working with large files.. Capturing video, downloading things from Bittorrent, etc then it would definitely help to defrag the system every now and then.  For optimization I would check out Cocktail, and for defrag I would check out iDefrag. 
Mrs. Butterworth makes syrup but like Aunt Jemima she does not make maple syrup! 
The guy on the bike is the anti-Stig.  
On the contrary, assholes who say that socialism has not been vilified enough have not been responsible for the deaths of tens of millions of people or the destruction of untold amounts of wealth, so I'd have to disagree.
Dump the crocks in a boiling bowl; Pound them up with a thumping pole; And when you've finished, if any are whole, Send them down the hall to roll!  That's what Bilbo Baggins hates! So, carefully! carefully! with the plates!   edit:  Sheesh.  Apparently no Tolkien Fans among the modders so far.

I wish.  For real, drinking on the job is not allowed, although tempting. We may have a glass to go with lunch, but we're can't pour ourselves glasses while giving tastings, or just have wine throughout the day and then serve people drunk. That's frowned upon. 
Most hospitals no longer allow smoking, at least in the US. While she was there they still did though. People tend to smoke more out of boredom. Even with all the activities it is still a very boring place. The staff tries to get everybody to quit.
Why would I do that when I could just put it in the bedroom? Who are you and what have you done for me lately?

No, I'm really not. I honestly want to see how the OP answers these questions. I don't know why anyone wouldn't expect it, his entire AMA is about him getting away with a crime! Are these not valid questions to ask?
&gt;all you need to do is click this link      &gt;I clicked the link! Now what?    &gt;also you have to do a shit ton of studying and drawing practice
So you acknowledge a barrage of information pointing to a logical conclusion, yet deny the logical conclusion itself?  Must be a Fox News Viewer!
Well genius, research and science show that mental illness is more likely to occur in inbreeding, not mixing races.  Science, verses what your aunt said about breeding dogs, that's what you want to go with.  EDIT: spelling
Yeah WinXP would be fine, except that I don't have a legal license for it.
I already got Windows 7 Pro, 32-bit and 64-bit. I've just been lazy in backing up my stuff to wipe my hard drives and start fresh in Windows 7. I should do it already.
I did pretty much the same thing, only I was pulled overboard by the extremely large cat fish and dragged 30 or 40 meters, and when I finally let go of the line I found a shiny ring in the mud.  That ring, unfortunately, I lost.  But I hear it ended up in some really good hands.  Not trying to be the one-up guy.
Yes indeed, line, bowl, or supersoaker however they want to distribute it.

There would still be food-stamps and welfare. It's just that you would need to be in a ridiculously bad situation to need them. And when you do need them, they would only need to be a top-up, bumping you up from your current wage to the amount you need to support yourself.
see it.
Thanks very much. Time to be creepy.
Can you fix that or is it not your pic?
You rock...thanks...going to pass that around to some peeps..
Yay! Thank you so much! :)
I agree - that was one of the things that caught my attention at the time.  It was mid-afternoon when I took the shot, if I recall correctly.  
Yeah, learn what socialism is and get back to me.  
Yeah I'm thinking about getting used. Did you follow the diet as well? 
Any erection was frowned upon.  I don't think people were shunned because of it they were a little more mature than that.  They were also a generally older crowd so it wasn't that much of an issue.  As for the women, there usually wasn't a problem unless she was doing something about it.  
Thanks.  I got it from [this guy's gallery](http://orioto.deviantart.com/).
I'm an American. We have fairly significant social programs and subsidy programs which fail miserably. I call you authoritarian because you are. It's disgusting, I guess you have a problem with free will, free markets, and free men. So tell me, how is not supporting any subsidies against my best interests? Also, who are you to say what is and isn't my best interests? I'm sure if a conservative told you what was in your best interests you'd surely reject it. But that is because you are not influenced by the big nasty corporations right? Like the one that provides you your electricity, your house, your computer, your internet, your T.V., your food? Those big evil corporations that provide us with so many services and goods that want to make a *gasp* profit.  
At least the guy was cocky enough to retort.
Now I know what happened that one time when I tried to fly the helicopter.  I was like... shit I can't go up... what the fuck... then all of a sudden down and crash.  Showed the UAV and I was like.. hunh?
Dammit, I came here to say that. 
They will not need Japanese Kamikaze pilots to do their bidding, you are right.
How did you "fix her"?
Or Donald Sutherland.
Seemed to me that the poster of this story took great joy in the prospect of a pastor getting a brain tumor.
Oh my Zeus, I can't wait for the hypocrisy. It actually makes my blood boil thinking of what they'll say. "Can't you just leave us in peace to grieve!" NO, fuck yourself with a machete.
so sexy. is there any way to make windows look like this?
What on earth are you even talking about?  All that "Open Source" means is that the information in question is available to the public.  "Closed source" would imply actual espionage.  Things which are by definition not available to the public.  It has nothing to do with the variety of sources or the quality of the information.  Selective source makes no sense in the context of this discussion.  
That is what going to happen to my TV. Bedroom. Finally can play XBOX with out get the look of disapproval from the wifey.
Oh, that and "The Cell". The horse vivisection scene was somewhat disturbing.
New favourite novelty account.
I'm so jealous. What did you think of Vanuatu? 
His name is Robert Paulson. 
Run..... **RUNNNNN!!!!1!**
It being driven hard did occur to me and it is a concern.  However, how much benefit does the engine rebuild have on its wear?
They shock your brain in certain areas, with certain precise amounts of electricity to try to kill areas of the brain responsible for the undesirable thoughts or feelings. It is done 2-4 times a week until results are seen or they decide it isnt working.  EDIT:clarity.  EDIT 2: This description is what I got from a doctor I asked about it, if it is not accurate I apologize. 
Very cool.
Are you seriously?
He's done a LOT for their cause and visibility if you think about it. My dad hates the guy because he went to military funerals with GOD HATES AMERICA and GOD HATES FAGS signs.  The enemy of my enemy is my friend. My dad can agree with gays that this Phelps guy is a dick... in my book that's progress. He's tolerant of gays because he has something to agree with them on.
..is never an appropriate response to anything.
&gt;These guy's don't even really believe what they're saying.  I don't buy it. While I think there's validity to the legal angle, from the interviews and documentaries that looked into it there's no way they're not religious nutjobs. With the amount of kids, especially. Kids in general are just crappy actors, and even worse at improv. 
No, I was saying, in my poetic way, that though such programs do exist, they are not any good for what you want. I find the best way is to work it out on your instrument, or better yet, get somebody who's experienced to do it. Barring that there are lots of tabs/free sheet music/ringtones and such (which will all give you notes) available.  I also wanted to gently let OP know that they were being a little wishful.  Ok?  *edit for addressing correct person*
Is religion a prerequisite for being poor?  Is religion a prerequisite for success or intelligence?  Of course not.  If there is a disconnection between religion and wealth, perhaps that stems from the arrogance of some who believe themselves to rule their own little world and see no need for an Almighty God to usurp their high position.     It seems that your continued use of the world dumb, stupid, and what not, is very hateful.  Perhaps my sensitivity is because I am watching a movie on mental retardation.  It just seems to be malicious on your part.    You say forget about America, but I haven't seen any hard statistics regarding the rest of the world and religion, so I can't really speak of that.
Would you also suggest that you never join the military, join the peace corps, take an overloaded semester at school (while working), or doing any of the numerous other things that mean that you don't have a lot of free time to waste on the internet?  What about trying to walk the Appalachian trail?  Hitchhiking through Europe?  Should the only people who use freenode be those who never go AFK and do something for a few months at some point in their lives?  That seems to be what you're suggesting.
Great choice. Any idea where yet?
Yeah, surfboarding with deadly jellyfish the size of a pin head. Two different species at that.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Box_jellyfish  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irukandji_jellyfish
the realized this a very long time ago
How the hell do people come up with these ideas?
The other guy looked much more like a short and stocky football player than a nerd. He probably had at least 50-60 pounds on me. I may have only weighed around 130-135 pounds at that time.
just in general
I got lucky. My LDR worked out, but we started by meeting in person. Most relationships don't work out. This time, it's not really your fault that it didn't work out.
Unless they're playing video games (more specifically, they're probably 12 years old playing Warcraft III) or posting anonymously on a messageboard- then discretion to the wind! Everyone is *racial slur here*!  
If you want to avoid naked people, I doubt a nudist resort is the place to be for you.
mvgroup.org  I couldn't think of a good pun.
can you please post the original wallpaper, thank you!
In terms of their science, they are amazingly effective.   It's pretty cool to see a Roundup Ready crop shake off Roundup Powermax without any noticeable damage.   But really, most of the fearmongering I see is based mostly on ignorance. 
Total agreement. I was not addressing a specific survival scenario, more a general after-math scenario.  I made the assumption that the OP had survived the initial collapse, and was concerned with skills for surviving long term.  Having the skill to build a rudimentary shelter is essential.  That's why it was in my first few items of skills that should be considered an absolute requirement.
 No your attorney couldn't say that, but in reality no one can tell you to do that. They are legality required to report you if you make a claim that your going to do something illegal. But from what the OP said, the lawyer wasn't advising him he might have known the OP was going to skip bail but cases like those are hard to press because of Attorney client privileges. Whos gonna report him the person he helped? He was doing something illegal technically but its a hard case to prosecute and would never end up with him being arrested or losing his license. A lot of lawyers do this, unitentionally and intentionally. 
The accident report probably won't be available for another 24 hours.  I'm going to be talking to my insurance in the morning.  What should I expect the lawyer to be able to do for me after I have this information?
Ranked as the [ninth](http://www.globalfirepower.com/country-military-strength-detail.asp?country_id=Japan) strongest military in the world.  Not overwhelming, but still significant.  What they lack in manpower they can compensate in technology (which is still decades ahead of the Chinese military).
I think you're forgetting the golden rule.
Terry will never be gone: Like Mozart, his will live forever through his art.  *Snifff*
Yes... suspension of disbelief and whatnot.  But still... if your physiology made water hazardous to you, you would never go to a planet that has anything similar to our humidity, let alone our surface water.
Seriously. Seeing as how the human body has anywhere from 55-78% water (varied based on body size). Just touching a human would be enough to cause a burn - not to mention the water in the atmosphere.   I certainly hope the spacecraft stayed away from the clouds. Maybe avoiding the dew on the ground formed in the night would also be a good idea...
A point I was hoping to make is that the level of anger you're thinking of should be the baseline rage. Breaking a pencil during a test isn't rage. Rage is when you're throwing chairs across the room, threatening to kill internet search companies.
It's ironic too, because most of them *are* kids.
are you kidding?  baseball is the only all-star game with any significance.  the winning league gets home-field advantage in the World Series.  because of this, yes.  pitchers DO reach speeds they do in normal games.  perhaps you haven't watched an MLB all-star game lately.
I clicked the link. I read the title. I quickly closed it ... I didn't even see the video and I feel itchy ... lol ... jerk :D
I read it on reddit itself yesterday, but I can't find it.
Holy shit - this is hardcore.  Care to share what the numbers correspond to?
It's for people who's lives are somewhat *less* than average.

I...have no idea. I didn't notice and have never been able to do it prior. 
Fitness is always relative between organisms. Furthermore, fitness is not absolute. The dinosaurs are not to blame for being killed off by the meteor; and some of the creatures that survived and went on to flourish may have been destined for extinction in the pre-meteor world.  If an organism doesn't reproduce, then evolution does not apply to it, since (generally) evolution happens as a consequence of reproduction. Also, if an organism is immortal but doesn't reproduce, then most likely, other organisms that do reproduce within the same ecological niche would eventually crowd it out.   You know, the same way that intelligent people are being crowded out by idiots.

They're also opposed to the Jews.  They protested my building on thursday, because it housed the Anti-Defamation League.  When I went down for lunch there were about 4 protesters holding 2 signs each, vastly outnumbered by anti-protestors playing Peaches' "fuck the pain away" on the boombox and holding up a variety of clever signs.  I love SF
The moon's helium-3 is aparently a consideration for the [Chinese Lunar Exploration Program](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Lunar_Exploration_Program):  &gt; Ouyang Ziyuan, one of the most prominent Chinese experts in geological research on underground nuclear testing and extraterrestrial materials, was the first to advocate not only the exploitation of the known huge lunar reserves of metals such as iron, but also the mining of lunar helium-3 as an ideal fuel for nuclear fusion power plants. He is now in charge of the Chang'e program. He is known to be one of the strongest supporters of the Chinese human lunar exploration program.  The Chinese did have a plan to put humans on the moon by 2020; I don't know if nuclear fusion will be economically viable by then, though, or whether helium-3 will be used in its production.
I kind of think we'll evolve into two separate species. One which is intelligent as fuck and the other that is strong as fuck but dumb as a doornail. Kinda like in The Time Machine although I doubt they'd start feeding on one another.  But yeah by and large the stupid out-breed the intelligent.
That'll do it.
sorry, i should expand on that more, you said you didn't like it because it was ugly. You can apply GTK themes to it. Not sure what's buggy on yours.
I've heard this from a number of historians, as well.
Yeah, I just don't want to make it seem like a hack. Alright, I'll have to do some tinkering I suppose with whatever looks most promising there for now...
I missed it too until I noticed how many people mentioned he missed it.
The city owns the stadium.
I guess I'm not the only one whose body leaks paint instead of blood.
Awesome! Tell your sister that an internet stranger wishes her a happy bday. 
No. And she wasn't my girlfriend at the time of the chess game.
Her exact words, "he loved me".
Maybe that's it - I have 0.9.2.
Okay: Next question - Do you live in the middle of the woods? If you don't, are there a lot of broad-leaf trees (that is to say, not evergreen) nearby?  Edit: Aww heck. I won't keep you guys in suspense any more.   I am:  99% certain that this is a (damaged) caterpillar nest, and  75% certain that it is a Gypsy Moth Caterpillar nest. (most of virginia is smack-dab in gypsy moth central, and there aren't too many other "tenting" caterpillars in the appalachians other than the eastern Tent Caterpillar - see below)   If its not that, then I am  24% certain that it is a Eastern Tent Caterpillar, *Malacosoma americanum*  Now: I am NOT an Entomologist (so I could well be wrong here), but i have buddies who are. With your permission, Ill send this link to my bud who works as an agricultural extension agent for the state of North carolina. He deals with  pest species like this all the time.  
I'm lucky: wifey doesn't mind me firing up the Xbox after I've made dinner. There are just some games she doesn't like, like the *Ace Combat* series.  We're digging into *Assassin's Creed II* right now.
I wasn't forced I did it because I wanted to, and I wanted him to like me.  Even as a child my fantasies were focused on Men controlling me, or having magical powers over me.  A particular one was a magic wand that made my breasts bigger. ironically the after puberty me did not need a wand. Another was I was  hypnotised into being a literal sex doll to be passed around. (this came from a playboy cartoon I read around the age of 9) 
Thats sad, but what is wrong with America? The Accelerator gets stuck and no one can think of what to do in a car to fix it? First off, even with it speeding up, applying the breaks slowly would slow it down until they could shift into neutral.   Its crazy they have time to get the phone, dial 911, wait for someone to talk to them, but can't fathom putting the car into neutral? Scary I think we need harder driving tests in America, its a real tragedy.   
The first time it kinda freaked me out. The only bonus to it was at least I knew she wasn't faking. Strangely (or maybe not) her favorite place to do it was the floor. In one of our only conversations about it she said "you know, so I don't fall down." I've often thought about that, like, how weird it would be to feel more secure on the floor than in a bed. Her losing consciousness must have been accompanied by a feeling of falling or something. So that was our sexual relationship; me banging the shit out of her on her bedroom floor until she passed out. She was also prone to fainting at other times too. For some reason, whenever I see those "fainting goats" I think of her. I don't mean that like an insult, just that she was very simple-minded. Very blonde might be a better way to put it. 
Burlington, most likely.
That economic system that consistently fails in spectacular fashion?  I'm aware of it.
Is that the one where the ventriloquist's hand is actually some freaky creature with sharp teeth that's controlling him?  I'm almost positive that was a Tales From the Crypt episode, though.  
Take your fucking anti-wheat propaganda somewhere else.
As a fellow lover of physical books, shame on you for your evil enjoyment of harming books. :p
Surprisingly accurate portrayal of what I'm currently doing:  drinking beer and listening to The Cure (I know, what is it, 1989?).
Thankfully I don't live under a foreign, ruthless, illegal and murderous occupation. And I certainly would retaliate, as the palestinians retaliate against the illegal occupier that's blockading their ports and interdicting their airspace -- acts of war, illegal per the UN charter. War crimes. It's not just for Germans. 
Exactly!  Jesus, they may have strung you up for a ritualistic murder.  What happened with that relationship?  I hope to god it was over the moment you left that place.
Oh, I'm sure by today's standards it will be corny as heck.  
I can only tell you what I use as an example. I prefer my interface pretty dark, so here's what I use:  Service Icons: Aqua Status Icons: Stockholm Menu Bar Icons: Adium Flashy Emoticons: Adiumy Dock Icon: Adiumy Red  color Theme: Decay 2.0 list layout: Decay 2.0 Window Style: Regular Window Opacity: 85% Automatic sizing on, Size to fit vertically on, size to fit horizontally off Max width 160px  That's pretty much what I prefer, and what I feel matches my layout considering my menubar, desktop background, and dock style.  Play around with the options, if you don't find something that tickles your fancy, there are plenty you can download as well.
Amen, sister.
This. Nothing has helped me fight depression as much as running has. Sex is also good, for physical and emotional reasons. Do as much as you can of both!
unless you go to private school!
Or we could continue to spend a few hundred years optimizing compilers, and get much better/faster results.
Dude. Here I thought I was one of the select few who know of the magical goodness that the combination of Honey Bunches of Oats mixed with Frosted Mini Wheats creates. Mmmm...
yes, but it's exactly that type of thinking that will hinder change.   Be the change you want to see in the world. According to your logic, if everybody took that advice and paid with cash, then the situation would fix itself.
Hey! you can't RUSH science. We need data before we can tell you an educated guess.
I still feel there is a rather large distinction between making oneself seems like a god fearing and pious man and simply allowing the Catholic church to once again exist in the country.  It was simply a logical political move to roll back some of the ultra radical religious reforms that were put in place during the Revolution.    
If it wasn't that way, all the filipinos would spend money on products made else where , and they money would leave the country, with none coming in. 
Well I'm quite glad it helps in some way during that time!
the chinese food scene where all the food had maggots and roaches and eyeballs.  and the fortune cookie spelled disaster. terrible moment especially since it was chinese food after the movie :s
a .22 would have been cheaper, and not smelt like cat shit all the time
Yes, constantly actually. I think that's probably one of the keys to making it work. We have a lot in common, but still it would be foolish to ignore the obvious (I think). I made sure she was comfortable with those sorts of comments first of course, but having that freedom is nice, especially when you're curious about something that you might otherwise be nervous about asking.
I wish!
I don't know what's going on there (I'm not all that computer savvy) but that is awesome to look at.
What about /r/FFFFFFFUUUUUUUUUUUU?
haha why did people downvote that?
why can't we all just get along and be happy?  I honestly considered removing it from my bar to make it more reddit friendly but w/e
you obviously dont realize what you're saying so let me make it simple on you  first of all the universe is mindbogglingly huge, there has to be another earth-type planet suitable for us, probably even a relaxing smaller earth so that we weigh less and can play a bit better basketball  second, how do you say "we cant get rid of our problems by finding a new place" without first realizing that our place we live in now is in fact, full of problems?, and that finding a new place would actually be beneficial since our place apparently has so many problems? do you think before you speak?  you're one of those psuedo intellectual types who thinks he has a good bit of commentary on everything, i've looked at your posts, you fuckin flamer , thats what gets me riled up, the fact that douchetypes like you have so many posts on one of my favorite newsdiggs
I think that the Reaper ships are all the same, the actual reapers inside would be different.  The baby human Reaper would be nowhere near  the size of the ship, even full grown.
Hmm...
STAND AT THE GODDAMN POSITION OF ATTENTION WHEN YOU TYPE REPLIES TO ME, MAGGOT!!!
You lot are just crazy.
i second this
Once again - Great choice. I live in Burlington and it's an awesome town. Everybody is really friendly and there's a lot of culture here. 
Once upon a time in a great castle, a Prince's daughter grew up happy and contented, in spite of a jealous stepmother. She was very pretty, with blue eyes and long black hair. Her skin was delicate and fair, and so she was called Snow White. Everyone was quite sure she would become very beautiful.
&gt;unspoken  You seem to have messed that one up...wouldn't it have been more, er, *fitting* to just downvote me into oblivion too? That said, thanks for the heads up.  So why don't we just quietly delete the three comments we've left? I'll delete this specific one after you delete yours....
"Emotional porn"... Yeah, that sums it up pretty well.  It's also depressing as hell.
No but there are widget alternatives such as [screenlets](http://www.screenlets.org/index.php/Home) and [SuperKaramba](http://netdragon.sourceforge.net/ssuperkaramba.html)
gah! well maybe you will appreciate that I hate opening new books for fear of breaking the binding. many a time i have barely opened it and peered into the V shaped crevice and attempted to read it!
I think not enough people do this. I'm sure many of you thought when you were younger that your parents were utter Nazis about everything but later grew up to understand why they did what they did.
Dammit. I've been trying to find this out for a while... Might go to /r/askreddit about this one. Thanks.
Also, why shouldn't customers be allowed to ask if they can modify an order?  They are paying for the food and should be allowed to have their food prepared a certain way (within reason.)
Yes, there is a reason behind it. In short Equifax+Transunion (but not experian) have a buffer limit for inquiries that is shared between soft and hard.  So if you pull your credit enough yourself it will bump off the hard pulls from credit inquiries.
"but .. staggering amount of research and innovation into what, exactly?"  They're obviously researching AS MANY WAYS TO KILL YOU AS POSSIBLE.  MWAH-HA-HA!
I'd like to see your conclusive proof that there are bots on Reddit, downvoting this submission.
The numbers are the various workspaces I have available.  An orange number is the workspace I'm currently on.  A white number has open windows.  A gray number is empty.  The stuff on the far right is the date and time because I can never remember what day of the week it is.
Start with Detroit. Decades of very liberal Democratic leadership has led to a crime ridden cesspool of entitlement. 
Ignorance of what?  Please explain, I'm curious.  
Karma works for me! Upvote me because I posted at the end of this thread!
Excellent taste. I enjoy those artist as well...tho I havent listened to Nas seriously anymore particularly since God's Son. I do own Hip Hop is Dead. Great stuff, great thread.
Robert Smith never came up with anything that could match ["I Don't Believe in Love"](http://popup.lala.com/popup/576742279060738437) from Queensryche's 1988 magnum opus, *Operation Mindcrime*.  
Makes sense, thanks for taking the time to explain it.
Ah, you seem to have problems understanding.  Comment searching does nothing to help you find relevant links.  Nothing you can say will change that.  If you would like to search all comments you need to start using "site:reddit.com" in your google searches and stop bitching at reddit for not being google.
That's what we've read/heard. Really looking forward to it.
I never said I was a genius. It's stupid not to ask questions. Have they fully researched it? :)
I didn't want to pile on, but the first thing I said to my girlfriend was that I recognized the burnt potatoes and miserable veg as being ubiquitously British.  We do Sunday roast because of my time over there, every sunday without fail...
Yes, I am comparing "most guitar sheet music" to "most tabs" :) 
Don't be so quick to underestimate the housecat.
waaat
Well,  anybody could go in and change your public key;  of course it would look shady in your user history but what's the chances of somebody checking that every time?
This was a long time ago, but I think it was something with a puppet controlling the ventriloquist.   Oh! Found it - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dummy
You and me both.
Problem solved.
I like Arab culture, but the language is utterly useless when it comes to the regions I'd want to work in after leaving the military. As for Chinese, I don't really even like the food, much less anything else about the country.   I'm all for supporting my host country, but going into the linguistics field seems like it would develop a set of skills so specialised that I wouldn't want to waste the opportunity by learning a language which I would never actually use outside of the military. 
Interesting. I used to think that jsoverson's answer was correct and in fact, I remember doing the math for the ice skater example in my thermodynamics class and it working out all right. I might try redoing it later. However, after playing a bit with WolframAlpha I found that it gives 0.002573ºC as the temperature needed to melt water at 1atm but it gives 6120atm as the pressure needed to melt water at 0.002573ºC which is, at the very least, inconsistent.  [Wolfram](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=melting+point+of+water+at+1atm) [Alpha](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=melting+point+of+water+at+0.002573+C)   This inconsistency seems to disappear for your -5ºC example so the problem might be with working to close to that near vertical line.   
With all due respect, I find that hard to believe. The riff that comes in at around 0:20 are quarter notes played at 210 BPM. That riff alt. picked is cake, but trying to play it with just down-picks (as Metallica does) can prove to be difficult.
As absurd as it is, they're just the ones participating.  Their action legitimizes some people's beliefs.  Which kind of sucks.
Yeah, the e-ink screen is what pretty much sold me on the idea of e-readers. Long battery life is also a plus, since I'd probably be using it on the commute to school.
That it is.
I came here to post this too.  After I saw it, I insisted on checking the necks of my parents for implants.  And how about that pull-the-rug-out ending?  
Being a biotic myself, I found Jack absolutely useless against anyone with a shield or an armor. I played the entire suicide mission with Miranda and Thane. All three of us had maxed out Heavy Warp. Three warps can bring down almost anything instantaneously.
Read the article.  It says his house was raided and tapes were taken.
Go into your start menu, go to run, then type cmd and enter. Once you are in there just specify the path to that shortcut and type "del INSERTPATHHERE" (make sure there is a space between del and the path). Once you have done that it will say Y/N just type Y and hit enter.  If you need the path to the shortcut just right click on it, go to properties and copy and paste the path (you can't CTRL + V in cmd prompt so just right click and hit paste instead)
Lol ms paint for windows 7 and some shit the guy called "Headband". 
I think you'll find the Jews killed Jesus, which was not cool, because the guy was clearly mentally ill, he had the original Jesus complex
I  will get aggressive to get sex. I have a high sex drive.  I would take turns if he ordered me too, but I don't enjoy causing pain.   Hell take turns, or draw straws the only rules are the ones the both of you agree to. 
this looks absolutely retarded.
Ohhh I was thinking you were eating some Chinese food and watching that scene.  Also, didn't that scene have the weird crawly thing on the table with the eyeball?
But, like you said, it's just a TOY!  You'd retaliate against a toy?
Friends don't let friends let women hit them. (Ladies, if you want equal rights, you can take equal lefts as well.)
i think it's very spurious to commit to a long distance relationship before meeting IRL.  i don't care if you meet online, as long as the process of christening the relationship "official" is done after meeting.
Yes, I think there are grounds to say this, if not in the origin of the Abrahamic God then at least adopting Platonic influences into the Abrahamic tradtion. St. Augustine of Hippo, for example, was greatly influenced by Plotinus' neo-platonism. 
Then where's the damn Borealis?  Its too big to be that rotten wooden ship.
Yup. that was the one I was referring too. Thanks for saving me some time while I ate  (^.^)b
Unfortunately in today's age of databases and such... there are plenty of reasons that I would not tell a doctor anything except what I thought was relavent to my problem unless I could work it out so that we were talking strictly "off the record".     I don't want to find out 30 years from now that my insurance company wants to blame my youthful tobacco smoking for my current heart problems.
Yeah, it took a few tries to get a pattern I liked. It was a pain carrying 5 litres of water back and forth from the sink to where I was shooting, but it was worth it in the end.
Keep going...
See what happens when cousins marry?
Listen, I get your point. I'm basing my view on the views of the majority while openly admitting that this of course does not apply to everyone, that is not bigotry. It's not bigoted to say Italians like to eat pasta because if you are familiar with Italian cuisine, you know that is very apparent. That doesn't mean all Italians eat pasta, it's just a general statement. I know you won't get this, but try hard to read what I said and see if you can understand it.
I just read this post now. Great post OP!
I am so glad. Thanks
His name was Robert Vist.
Yeah. I believe it was Josephus that many historians use as a reference point. It is a fairly agreed upon date!
OH.  haha.  well, hopefully you'll have a good dinner tonight.  my sunday is winding down.  :(
How come every time I say this to people in my daily life, I get looked at like some kook, conspiracy theorist?
I did too, then I realized I didn't need 80% of the books.
Unfortunately, that was the *only* disturbing scene in the movie. 
Not really.  I worked at Home Depot for a bit and one summer I worked as a cashier.  As such, I had to work the self checkout and the regular check out.  Half the people who came through the self check out took longer either because they were retarded and had no clue how to follow directions and the half because the machines are a pain in the ass.  They have super sensitive scales in the bagging area and half the weights are wrong.  I only recommend it if you have a single item.  
He could possibly become a black hole any bucket of chicken now...  We must stop this man, in the best interest of humanity!
When'd he last upgrade it? I can't tell much from the pics since I mainly just see the motherboard and RAM, but when you get it up and running, please do post the specs, I've always been very enthusiastic about computer parts, upgrades and whatnot. In fact, I just upgraded my processor last week (to an AMD Phenom II Quad-Core 965 Black Edition, 3.4GHz stock frequency), and before that, my graphics card, which I got for Christmas (an ATI HD 5770 1GB). I'm getting a lot out of it, it's a great little gaming rig, but I'm gonna upgrade it yet again soon enough, as I'm planning on getting a new motherboard and RAM.  It's honestly a fun hobby, but it can be expensive, especially when all this is mainly just done for the sake of getting better performance and image quality in games. Then, when you get into overclocking...ahhh, let's not even go there, let's just say it's essentially like a drug.
*Impressed*  Maybe you're one of those people whose pheremones outdo the BO, or you just don't have any.. personally, it's at *least* once a day for me.  Unless.. these gfs didn't all have dreds, though, did they?  Cos if they did, you can't count them, since they won't have any sense of smell themselves :D
Burton was only credited on one song on [...And Justice for All](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/…And\_Justice\_for\_All\_\(album\)), which wasn't crappy like their new stuff. In other words, I don't think Cliff's death has much to do with why their newer stuff is such.. crap. From Puppets, to And Justice, to the black album, and the newer releases, they've all been stylistically very different from the next.  I think their newer stuff isn't as good as the old because Lars' drumming never really evolved, James' songwriting doesn't have the aggressiveness it used to, and Kirk's love for pentatonics and the wah got boring. Music theory only goes so far. Dimebag, for example, didn't know any. But he just loved the shit out of what he did, and he kept it real.
Thank you, sir.
I kept my own 'cash register', and I had to pay the house at the end of each night.  I had a standard large pizza sized drink tray that I had with me at all times and there was a small black box that I could keep my money and receipts in.  
It is widely reported that Bill Clinton had a swear-filled meltdown when he was told that he could not implement the economic program that he campaigned on and the American people voted him into office to implement -- all because his economic program met resistance from banksters and Wall Street. Somehow, I bet that 1992 version of Clinton would agree with the part of the article you quoted.
&gt; You either have the discipline to take care of yourself or you don't. The bottom line.  I've always found that intelligence is inversely correlated with frequency of making either/or statements like this.
YES WE CAN!
I that solved it! thanks.
Yes! I also find myself in the latter category! If I can't repair/replace/extend the life of whatever it is with something I already have lying around the house I'm far less interested and I will tinker with something until it's utterly ruined before giving up.
Nicely done.  Menciaing sucks.
I'm also wearing Secret
As far as being peaceful that is a definite no.  It was hard being around them, people kicking walls and screaming and crying all day and night. She made a few "friends" but no one she bothered keeping in touch with.  As someone with issues of my own, I can understand why she was the way she was. I dont consider myself a caregiver, but I do have a compulsion to try and "fix" broken women. I dont try to make life too easy for her, I want her to be a functional adult not like a kid who has everything done for her. She understands that I am here for her if she needs me, but if she can do something herself, she does it.  
I have an in-law who never orders off the menu, always demanding that they make a special dish for her.  That was embarrassing enough, but then she would always complain about it and often sent it back.  We finally stopped going out to dinner with them.
Everything about that movie is geared toward fucking up children. Why any parent would think it a good idea to watch it with their kids is beyond me. 
Wow.. way to assume something really really mean about a total stranger
Perhaps, but it sure is a striking coincidence.  
&gt;yeah, I think he's a bit over paid **;)**  
I guess its different for everyone, for me, that comes in at "Your coworkers hacked your email and responded to gay personal ads at craigslist." True story. It fuggin sucked. 
&gt;Cross dressing guy  &gt;Nudist resort  Uh... huh.
No screaming just eyes rolling.
Ah, "there's no point in arguing with you." Sounds like a way to get out of justifying your position.  You're right. That is just your opinion, which holds no more (or less) weight than mine. You don't consider him among the greats of literature. But some of us do, and the fact that you disagree doesn't make you correct.
Serious question: What's so bad about Lil Wayne's music?
Clearly not.  
The little demons creeped the fuck out of me.  It was the way they walked (because of the bad 80s special effects) that got me.  Guh.
"too bad" is just a turn of phrase. I meant 'still/even though'.
I will advice you dis-continue to talk to the insurance, and let a lawyer do that in your behave. The lawyer should charge you 20-40% percent of the settlement. You will cost you nothing while get you what rightfully yours, and get the ass of the other driver, especially hit-and-run.
Haha, I believe it!
Yes. Particularly if they're raping you.
It's in VA, not Madagscar.
They were in the firey throes of love, I'm sure.
Not sure. I'm hoping it wasn't human.
Your elliptical is just estimating. If you want to know how many calories you burn, you're better off getting a heart rate monitor.
In xp it can be removed via the desktop cleanup wizard. In win7/vista you have to edit the registry. It's a 5-min fix. Google is your friend on that one.

He actually slammed a bunch of r/atheism comments into one giant one.
And smoke grenades....every class....all the time!
Meh, you're the same kind of person who thinks all southerners are racist and hold other bigoted views.  To you, it is OK as long as their white.
Depends on how it's been driven since. Think about this. A Subaru engine was driven so hard it needed to be rebuilt after less than five years. That same person then drove this one for another 8,000 miles.   I did a quick run through some ads, and $15k would buy you a 2009 Impreza (admittedly an RS) from Manchester Subaru near there. Are the mods he has done attractive to you? Or would you have put others on (or none at all)? IF they are attractive, it's worth checking out. Otherwise why not pay $10k for on around 2005 vintage (but driven by someone older than 25-30), then start modifying it yourself?  * edit: I kant speel.
Perhaps I should mention this the next time my feminists professor wants to talk about how bad it is for women because they don't get paid as much as men.  YEA WELL WE DON'T HIT THEM AS MUCH EITHER!
this is a very good idea.
Pointing out sarcasm on the web always makes things more confusing :/
Here's the weird thing, he's definitely gotten better. One of his gifts is that he can write in way that the reader doesn't need a degree in economics to understand, but he's still a nerd.
Huh. I did not pick up that that was always the case. Certainly with some characters, but I didn't see it with all of them.  Interesting.
Sorry my auto correct doesn't work well. I meant oppose not poised
Perhaps that was the root of his annoyance.
Well, if you look at it as a reflection of our youth, yes, it is depressing. But if you look at it as a "Hey I'm really glad that's not me" angle, then its almost uplifting. 
I did the basically the same thing, except my dick is 40 inches long, just like the catfish...
i have no problem understanding. you seem to be incapable of realising that your opinion of how search should work is not somehow more correct than anyone else's.   if you want to find links relevant to some topic then you need to start using google without a "site:reddit.com" specifier. it's quite good at finding relevant things - and much better than the old-web search engines that use the tagging/categories/keywords strategy you seem to think is fantastic. stop bitching at reddit for not being yahoo categories from the mid-90s.

Man, because of you, I'm gonna go hunt a buffalo, take the skin and leave the rest to rot.
Thank you, of course! Even for years after he got out, his wife and I were allowed to maintain a whenever she wanted it type relationship, with his assent. I am sorry we drifted apart, it was weird but a great way to spend a horny day. One time while he was in jail she had a friend and her date sleep over. We traded partners, halfway through the night. Good times!
Maybe she had a bunyon. Haha. 
Trophy case! Bah, ...*damn it...*  Edit: Nope no trophy
&gt; Okay: Next question - Do you live in the middle of the woods?  *Please say yes.  Please say yes.*  I live in Richmond.  OP, please say you're far, far away from me.
You have Priam confused with either Paris or Menelaus.
&gt;When you pull one out of the box, the first thing you'll have to do is hook it up to iTunes on your PC.  You know this for sure?

Larry The Cable Guy.  My teacher was a woman.  Never sell your movie rights to Fox.  
yeah, the ['Deb Cries'](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GtsLxQLJQPw) music is not really an official song or part of the soundtrack, just some chords played so it's pretty tough to find.    I have tried figuring it out myself, but I suck. I tried once to figure out the chords to ['Via Domus'](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XYxNfNLPKuQ) from the Lost video game OST, but failed miserably.   Since I'm not wanting to know how to play it but use the music for a short film I'm making, I'm taking the quickest route out.
No... The other people were doing the drugs also, Runawayy just had a better Lawyer. 
I'm not an expert on how credit reporting works, but if it's not his fault, there should be a mechanism on removing fraudulent or erroneous information from his credit report. He should talk to a lawyer or some other expert about this to get it fixed.
I'd hate to see what happens when she spills milk.
'Pressurise' was my favorite.  &gt;“Chinese intelligence services have also been known to exploit vulnerabilities such as sexual relationships and illegal activities to pressurise individuals to co-operate with them.”  Why not just 'pressure?'
Yes! I think I screamed when I first saw that. The movie itself wasn't frightening to me in general, but the way that scene was shot, it was very shocking. [Here it is](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QU6OsYUycSY#t=2m0s)

yes which unfortunately squirted either eye gook or blood and squealed to no end. it was horrific.

You all are a Buchanan of net nerds get a life outside of the dark room you sit in. And to the rest of yall and your grammer just get over your selves.

The Jonas brothers write better music then that crap.
The only time I've ever felt unaccepted was at the place I worked when I went full time. Everyone there knew me as a man and a lot of people had difficulty adjusting to me as a woman. Several women even complained about having to deal with a MAN in the bathroom. (Side note - six months later, the biggest complainer and person who pretended I didn't exist ended up working with me on a project and getting along with me pretty well.)  At my current workplace, where they've only ever known me as a transwoman there have been absolutely no problems with the restroom. And when I'm out somewhere the breasts and makeup give people enough of a pause that they don't say anything.
Right, because you speak for everyone on Reddit.
The U.nion of S.oviet S.ocialist R.epublics wasn't socialist?  
Care to share?
little thing called tax
I'd suspect his view of the type of people you describe would be significantly better than his view of those who, much like you, exude an air of dickishness and cynicism and presumably troll the internet looking to win small battles of semantics and wit so as to engorge and enlarge their e-penor.
that's the best way to browse reddit.
&gt;My point was that regulation is supposed to be in place to ensure competition.   But it doesn't. That's all that matters. Social Security was *supposed* to be sustainable until 2030. It isn't. The reality and outcomes are all that matter, not the idealism. Regulations rarely ensure competition, they discourage competition by setting up barriers and increasing the cost of entry.  &gt;Also, Soviet Russia was not "socialist" in any useful sense.  Once again, the same thing as above. It wasn't socialist in your idealistic Marxist sense, but in reality it was what socialism could manifest into.
Bugs, every start up it resets my virtual desktops to 1, and it crashed and reloaded several times, and failed to reload once. I am using the SVN from the AUR.  Also, I am aware of themeing it. However, the text looks horrid, and I do not see anyway of changing it, and the volume control applet is hideous.
You're nuts.  Sure some people may splurge on food when they work out.  But most don't.  Blood glucose levels are not a character flaw, they're part of the science of human physiology.   Something you seem to know nothing about.

You are a guitar player that really wants a Mac. Is that right?

His name is Robert Paulson.

We are already losing him.   Which is worse to go bit by bit or all at once?

It's true. I remember seeing Sean Hannity interviewing Shirley Phelps-Roper, and even the most secular leftist can be proud of Hannity in this case. It's [worth a watch](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPzpsnROtSc).
It was a MacBook by chance, however it would have been one of those blue clam shell ones, and it was the end connecting to the power point not the computer that he threw in place.

holy hell ... I desperately want to clean up that desktop :)
His name is Robert Paulson. 
CLEARLY SO!
The easiest way to scan books is by destroying their spine. This allows the pages to be laid flat across the scanner. The other options are to not destroy the spine and lay the book face-down, which causes the margin to look fucked, or to lay the book face-up and have a complicated system of cameras that take multiple photographs from multiple angles to compensate.
 Yea you know what that makes more sense. Hopely soon this healthcare shit will get togethor and prevent pre-existing conditions. I wasn't thinking about possibilty that insurance would get ahold of that information. 
i'll see your Toy Story and raise you 3 Ninjas: High Noon at Mega Mountain.
The blender scene sticks in my mind... behind the couch for me.
What do you want to talk about? The fact that Peter Jackson's friends were all middle-aged white guys?
"Remember me, Eddie?  When I *killed* your brother, I talked [falsetto] *JUST...LIKE...THIS!!!*"  (eyes turn into knives)  That was indeed terrifying.  As is the part immediately before it where the rubbery, flattened version of him his wobbling around.  Stop motion in general used to freak me out, but especially that.

well, no more polishing the ol' bishop, eh?

I hope that I have provided an ember of doubt in your mind. The mere fact that "hard statistics regarding the rest of the world and religion" could possibly influence your opinion shows that you are not a mindless drone. If, on the other hand I produced such statistics, would you be intellectually honest enough to consider them? (if not, you have much self-reflection ahead to do (can you be honest to yourself?)) Good luck, I hope one day you find truth.
alteran1 makes the most crucial point. Go in like you belong there. Walk in, find a stall. When done, wash your hands, check your hair, check your makeup, leave.

Here's an idea: GTA San Andreas Tetris
I brought Garrus along to cover this lack.  His maxed Overload + AP bullets took care of anything else.  Me (vanguard) and Jack played with them like puppets the second their armor and shields were down.

I've run off the back of a few of those myself when I was in Afghanistan and they were firmly planted on the ground.
I think you are right about this and many other points made about "the world" in the West - these points are made within an epistemic bubble which doesn't really include the rest of the world, so it really only has scope over wealthier parts of the western world.
First of how is that site determining what to rank.  It seems to me they are incorporating far more than just military might but economic and manpower as well.  Bogus source in my opinion as I can't even find their methodology, you should go beyond a simple google search next time.  As for technology, China is very much on par with Japan when it comes to current military technology. China also has more of the modern equipment while Japan still has some rather old technology filling out their ranks.  They certainty have the means to easily out match China technologically, but that is why China does not want Japan to fully rearm.     Just compare the air forces of the two countries.  With the size and advances being made technologically, China clearly dominates Japan.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan_Air_Self-Defense_Force#Aircraft_inventory  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People's_Liberation_Army_Air_Force#Aircraft_Inventory

I am no fan of Beck.
Retards aren't clever enough for this. Or stupid enough.
&gt; the fact that you disagree doesn't make you correct.  I couldn't have put it better myself.  For what it's worth, I explained myself and provided specific examples of works that are generally considered "literature" (there's those pesky quotation marks again!).  So, either you're being deliberately disingenuous, or you know exactly what I mean and have a chip on your shoulder over the fact that a favourite popular author of horror stories (which ***he himself*** calls "the Big Mac and Fries" of books) isn't considered as "important" or "influential" as some of the Canon's Nobel Laureates.   I suspect the former, but I couldn't really give a shit either way.    I like Stephen King.  But he's no F Scott Fitzgerald mate.  Get over it.
While I certainly understand your sentiment, anyone enlisting in US military hoping to "keep other people safe" is an utter idiot. I can understand, although don't necessarily approve of, if they do it to receive a scholarship, pay the medical bills of their mother, travel around the world, beat up natives or whatever, but saving people? Heh... no. He should have become a fireman, rescue worker or, if he really needs a gun and obedient bystanders to play around with, a police officer. Soldiers are trained to kill and, in the case of United States, usually not the guys, who are threatening their fellow citizens in any way or manner. It's this bizarre idea that the Americans seem to have in their heads, probably caused by the nauseating ubiquity of patriotism, that always kills me a little bit inside. Keeping people safe? What a joke.
You think the Westboro Baptist Church will give the public that kind of opportunity?  Underestimating the WBC, nigga..
Hmm, I must have missed the question mark. Alzheimer's is gaining on me.
Me too. *shiver*
I do have a beard.  Perhaps it's ironic?
Women her age are just *so* immature.
I so called the wife just to insist if she wants V-day to be recognized I expect March 14th to be recognized as well.
I sure hope you're being facetious. 
yea, i've seen that movie. Funny but sad.
Fuck that i've seen milk in a bag in Iowa. You're not special up there..
I read the book and then watched the film the other day.  3 hour film and at least half the contents of the book was missing.
Amazing!  A twofer.  I assume you are female, and I have never had a woman refer to her ladyflower as a "kooter".  Awesome enough.  But spelling it with a K?  Oro puro.
I'm not sure I understand.
Yep, plus there are no duties on Books.  [Canadian Customs Tariffs](http://www.cbsa-asfc.gc.ca/trade-commerce/tariff-tarif/2010/01-99/01-99-eng.pdf), Books start on page 763.

That explains what the Muslims have been up to.
I think it's funny that you went back and "fixed" several things. It's also very apparent that you are trying very hard to make it seem like you aren't being a twat.
Do you mean that you worked on the same topic, or do you mean that you were part of the research being reported on here?
We actually don't have Wal-Mart over here.

Dear babycheeses,  I like my yard to be covered in insects and seeds, please stop feeding/housing and caring for birds that destroy nature.  Thanks.
They need more of THIS kind of protesting though.  I'd like more people to know what's going on with them because as sad as it is there are bigots out there who feel legitimized by this.  There are also people who just see this at face value.  This sort of protest is helping to devalue their protest, and helps by having people there to explain it.  If no one does anything they can sue for, and they continue to be made jokes of, then they will run out of money.
One mile in two hours isn't so slow when you know you are heading for the stars. At any rate, it is our only hope for interstellar travel.

My parents were a little freaked out at first, but I was happier there than at my other job and the money was great.  I had them come visit me at work a few times, and although it would never be their lifestyle (lord I hope so), they respected it.  My friends all thought I was crazy.  Everyone in town knows about the resorts.  'I worked at a nudist resort' is always a great card to pull out at parties too.
You're presumably a musician, with Cubase as well as songs without titles yet. You probably use photoshop to make album colours or adjust the lighting from bandgigs. Judging by the fact that the song files aren't contained in some kind of file folder, you are either unorganized or lazy, (no worries I am too.) You have AOE 2 and Dragon age Origins on your computer as well, which means your at least a midlevel geek.  You also have your windows taskbar relocated, which means you probably want a Mac but can't afford it.  All this taken into account, I'd say you're a slacker, just like me!
For a quick second I thought it was "Count von Cunt", and I thought, "Why, how fitting!"
I highly suggest you start reading the entire history of Israel starting with 1890 to present. While there's history before this that is of note as well, the 1890 forward really gives you some context as to why Israel and Israelis can *never* be trusted on any level or recognized as legitimate or peaceful. The more you know about Israel and its history, the more you understand that being a gentleman to a pig is how a pig fucks you in the ass. While people with no context observing the conflict today consider the wrong side or both side pigs the reality of the struggle is far different than what your lying television has sold you.  To play by the rules is not how you win against Israel, that's how you get deceived by them.  http://www.jafi.org.il/education/jafi75/timeline.html  http://www.palestineremembered.com/Acre/Palestine-Remembered/Story725.html

Nope, it's Hong Kong international.
You don't see any benefits to our recognizing that we are all human beings riding the same rock through space? You find the petty squabbling between states amusing perhaps? Or maybe you just like the fact that we (assuming you are from what is referred to as the western world) are on top? You don't feel the least bit frustrated with the fact that the lions share of the worlds resources are used to build weapons of destruction to use on our fellow human beings? I can't even fathom how you could not see any benefits but I'd better stop now before I end up with a text wall so massive you won't bother to read it anyway.
Upvote for apologetic jerk.
Just browsing the site shows how biased they are.  They conclude that you always lose sensitivity after circ by asking 5 men.  I just got it done 6 weeks ago and I havent noticed a change in sensitivity at all.  Some people report highten sensitivity.  I've perused that site before a couple times for 2 years, it's clearly pointing people in one direction.  I didn't mean to attack the article you posted however, I did not check the citations.  I also kind of assume already infants experience mass amounts of pain.  And that has to be scarring in some way.  No one I know remembers it though so its hard to say...  I was just mentioning I've found that site to be the Fox News of circ sites.  And i've done massive amounts of researching to prepare for the op.
The exact same one that made the front page a few days ago.
Haven't seen it yet, but will look into it now.
Didn't you get the memo?  It's 2010.  We aren't doing that anymore.
Some other great motorcycle documentaries:  [On Any Sunday](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0067527/) - Directed by Bruce Brown, the guy that did all those surfing documentaries (Endless Summer).   [Dust to Glory](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0386423/) - Directed by Bruce's son. Documentary about the Baja 1000 race in Mexico. It's not all motorcycles, but one of the main story lines is about a guy doing the entire 1000 mile race on a motorcycle by himself (in one straight shot, no breaks except for refueling, etc.)   [The Doctor, the Tornado and the Kentucky Kid](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0861769/) - Directed by the same guy that did Faster. Instead of the entire season, this movie is just about the 2005 MotoGP race at Leguna Seca (first time MotoGP came back to the US in many years). The title refers to Valentino Rossi, Colin Edwards, and Nicky Hayden, respectively.
Hmm, I grew out of this in 2nd grade.  
Wow, you're right.  stupid me, fixed.
Their location was probably relevant because they crashed and someone had to come help them.

My best friend died in a drunk driving accident, the shirt is suppose to be taken literally, or at least i think. He would have already gotten a kick by me if if was meant to be a drunk driving shirt. Trust me.
That's even worse than I thought! Oh Amazon, after you put all the publishers out of business, all you will have to sell are shoes...
Judging from the name I'm going to say that one of them screams, one of them sings, the drummer has a double bass pedal and every song has a breakdown in which they chug a drop D, haha.    Your photo: I think there's entirely too much in focus here. I can see all the way to the back of the room, and it's emphasizing the fact that the audience is both small and only kinda interested. The flash has killed the ambient light, and ruins the "feel" of the show. This would also work a lot better from a lower angle, I think, at the very least to help isolate the band members from the audience and the rest of the room.
Somehow I don't think this qualifies as a "bargain." Felony shoplifting, however. . .
Christianity is easy.  You got two rules:  love God and love people.  Everything else follows logically from that.  When you screw up one of those two things, all you're doing is driving people away from Jesus.  And these Westboro guys?  They got both wrong.
I tend to keep important information behind more selective passwords and use some other ones for stuff that isn't necessarily important, so if someone got the password to my msn account I wouldn't be terribly fussed.  However I was not aware of that previously, and it is a tad strange.
Niko Bellic?
Well, if we're doing it so that it's pronounced the way it's spelled, it'd need to be vadge.  Neither vaj nor vage are pronounced the way I'm saying it. 
It's not a "funny ha ha" story, more like a "make you think" story. First it was funny, then it wasn't funny, and then it got funny again.
I don't have access to making a fire/self-clean oven. Any other sugestions?
Yeah, I stuck it out for another week; until he invited me to another show.
The insurance company would simply separate the claim in several covered limits, such as "allowed," "covered," "discount," and other categories that cover most, but not all, of high priced medical bills.  So a $60,000 bill like that, about $50,000 would be covered with good insurance.
Yes, also in most states you can freeze your reports too, so they couldnt pull it if they wanted to.
Really?  I myself am certainly preferential to Wilder as Wonka, but I think that Depp ultimately portrayed Wonka as more of an honestly crazy albeit functional person, whereas when Wilder play him, he ultimately came across as some guy who could, at any point, say "NAAAWW! Just messin' with ya'!"

Well I really can't speak for Americans as I am Canadian, so I will still hold onto my perspective when it comes to our soldiers.
Because as soon as the op deletes his, ours will be forever lost as well. If he doesn't we'll live on, and this unspoken tradition will remain "spoked", a faux pas on both mine and his part. So I'm kinda counting on him here.
Yep, it's true for me, too. Then again, I didn't start this thread by making unfounded assertions that I didn't back up.   I fully admit that I can be completely wrong, and most of my posts are just opinions.

Dude. That movie was violent and was a mindfuck. Why did I have to learn so early about death?
It's from France
I found the thing that kept fear scary for me was the way there would always be one of two straggling soldiers left (after you think you have cleared an area) creeping up behind you. The AI in general was enough to scare me at times. The horror factor did grow old, but it was more effective than DOOM - discovering the invisible bastards left some brown on my seat.
If they'd bring back The Hunted, then I'd be satisfied...
It wasn't. Much like The National Socialist German Workers' Party wasn't socialist...  Much like the Republicans in the USA aren't republican, the Liberal party in Australia isn't liberal, etc...

Google is jumping through the massive hoops they have to because Apple denied them the easy way after they had already done he work once.
It was a joke, kind sir. Anyway, I once watched a tv show on animal planet where a cat was stuck in a 90 foot palm tree, and before the rescuers reached it, it fell from tree, landed on it's feet, and ran away. True story. So, the cat would probably survive anyway. 
According to ME2 Cerberus was never a part of the Alliance and that is what I am trying to figure out.  Was it a story change/mistake that BioWare made or is the disparity done on purpose and there is still something left unrevealed that we will not know until ME3?  EDIT: And yes in ME1 Cerberus in not portrayed as part of the Alliance, but it is portrayed to be a top secret group (like the Salarian) STG that has gone rogue, not as an evil corporation.
Gosh, I vaguely remember this movie too...does anyone remember the name of it?
These films are often more fun when you watch them with some friends too. Army of Darkness and Braindead are some of my favorites, but put them on when some friends come over and they take on a whole new level of excellence. 
Odd.  I thought it was regarding the important of rotating every 15 minutes or so while you sunbathe.
you can do all that in the iPhone, iPod, and iPad.
It's not sensitivity - it's just stupid. Hair is hair, it's no big deal. I don't get on my fiance about shaving his face, because I know he would hate if he had to shave his growth every single day.   I also think it's a bit silly to criticize how women react when men are negative about how we groom and dress. It is men, after all, who have decided they can lay out the laws for *how* we can groom and dress. 
I'm a Red fan myself. I like the parallel story lines in it and it all wrapping together in the end.

I didn't really look at the shirts like that, but yea wow. You're right.
Even in the worst conditions I've only had to re-apply ever 200 miles or so.  During the summer I only have to apply every 400 miles or so.  Biodegradable too.
that's what the sign said, and it even had a little arrow--like "check out this narwhal ya guys.... right here"; it looked like a narwhal in person, perhaps the picture didn't do it justice.

Sounds like an easier method. I would do that if my camera had a decent macro function, but alas. I am running an air cooled 1000w in a 4x4 but am getting tired of soil and will be switching to some RDWC buckets after this harvest.  Nothing like smoking the fruits of your labor! Cheers (:
The garlic thing frightens me a little.  I did it earlier this month and afterward I felt so incredibly sore inside - the same kind of sore you get if you burn your mouth on hot food.  It was much worse than the pain of the yeast and it didn't seem to help the yeast, either.   I will try the oral probiotics though.

That brings up another point.  If you did the KKK thing with "God hates niggers" would you get arrested/sued?  Surely fag is equivalent to nigger in harmfulness?  If they ever stop by my town, I'll call around to see what I can do.  Seeing a hood really wouldn't be too surprising where I live.

I updated my post, so perhaps you didn't see the additional content.  Unfounded assertions?  It's all opinion, as you say.  Some would argue that magazines count as literature for goodness sake.  Hence my use of quotation marks.  The typed version of someone saying "Quote unquote, literature".

They are anti choice *because* they believe that abortion is "killing a baby", but that doesn't mean that the term "pro life" is appropriate. Saying somebody is "anti choice" isn't rude..it's a fact. They disagree with giving woman a choice to opt out of pregnancy. It's not treating them unfairly at all. Saying someone is pro life however, implies that they value life, and pro-choicers don't. It twists the concept a little. It would be like calling pro choicers "pro women" instead of "pro choice".   I always found that "pro life" was a way to discredit the other side of the debate with sensationalism. Pro/anti choice is more equal. Calling somebody anti choice isn't about a lack of respect. It's simply the most neutral.  
Rum FTW!
Sorrrrrrrrrrrry, but it IS the place to go for documentaries, they even have a section specifically for BBC!

You equate a voluntary activity with catching a plague?  Look, I drank for ~20 years.  At peak, I could kill a liter of gin, or about a case and a half of beer.  Before bed. As much water as you can reasonably hold (alcohol dehydrates).  In the a.m., 1/2-1 oz preferred brandy, in a tall coffee.    Sometimes the flavored brandies are easier on the tum than straight brandy.  Substitute Courvoisier or B and B for the above.

I'm not a fan of the Genesis Coupe, but that's what he mentioned in his original post regarding something he was looking at, so I used it as a price comparison.  I agree, the insurance might be expensive depending on where you live and if he is under the age of 25.  I did go onto say that I was not telling him to get the BMW.  I just wanted him to look into getting something used, that might be of higher quality since he mentioned later on that he wanted the most Horse Power for his money.
Thats nearly the same thing.

Yup, I understand, but lets look at what Ubuntu did. They ran a [poll](http://www.surveymonkey.com/s/GFVQP62) for proprietary applications that Ubuntu users wanted on GNU/Linux. I can understand Adobe Photoshop and even Skype being on that list, but poor software like iTunes, which doesn't respect user's rights, shouldn't be anywhere in the GNU/Linux circle. A lot of Windows and Mac users use these applications, because there are no alternatives available. However, when you step into the GNU/Linux world you do have options, numerous options, and we should be promoting that. In a sense promoting the culture of GNU/Linux where we have flexibility, user rights, fair use, and general freedoms that empower the user.  The way Ubuntu seems to mimic Windows &amp; Mac could lead it to become another Linspire. That would be very disappointing.
I wouldn't consider Gondry part of any established canon yet, but upvoted for the Arrested Development reference.
I was training for triathlon during the time when I tried Plyo the first time... I only made it to about 45 minutes in before I gave up too.  I stuck with it though and the 3rd time I was able to finish it.  I think that it's a sign that it's a good workout.    Also, if any of the stuff is too much for you, just take a rest break for a bit and jump back in when your heart rate is back in a good zone.  The fact that you weren't able to finish every exercise is great in my opinion, because it gives you something to work towards!

&gt;So all palestinians are terrorists?  Certainly not my conclusion. I don't know if that is how you feel.  &gt;Any way you put it, killing another person is BAD!   Really? Do you reject all self-defense? Or is it only bad if Israelis do it and not if Palestinians do it?   &gt;Shooting pregnant women to kill both the mother and the baby is BAD. Seems like eveything the Isralis do is BAD!  So all Israelis are terrorists? 
If only it was..........  I swear I could walk around for an hour sometimes without finding a single dinosaur I had enough ammo to kill. That game could have been so great.

That would make a fantastic movie! Or at least a television series. I'd love to see Meaning of LIff entries animated in the style that they used for The hitchikers guide to the galaxy entries in the old TV shows.
&gt; Once again, the same thing as above. It wasn't socialist in your idealistic Marxist sense, but in reality it was what socialism could manifest into.  Ok. But in this case this is what resulted from government being a lapdog for corporate America, not from socialism.

I may be downvoted to hell, but as a woman (way over the age of 13) I have to say that young girls are so sexualized that I feel very sorry for men. They have Disney bitches dressed up like strippers, and then when a guy gets a hard on because of it, they're like "OMG PEDOPHILE!!!!!"   I'm so glad I don't have a penis.
Well, it was technically 'clothing optional' except if you wanted to go in the pool you had to be nude.  We had a night club, and most people would dress up in lingerie and cute costumes (think Halloween year round).  A typical day as a patron of the resort was tan all day naked, drink all day in the sun and in the pool.  Have a game of water volleyball in the afternoon before lunch, tan more, drink more.  At around 5 the place would clear out and everyone would either eat at our restaurant or have dinner at home, shower, then come to the club in a cute outfit and dance and drink till 3.
The parents clearly have very little, if any, morals, and clearly do not give a rat's ass what other people think of them. I see no reason why lying to their kids for the sake of their scheme is unbelievable.

ff3 (6) was the first final fantasy game (and RPG?) I ever played, and the fact that it lasted for HOURS and just kept developing was so new and enthralling to me; I absolutely loved it.  I think I was in 5th grade at the time.  Chrono Trigger was the first game that actually made my cry; another amazing soundtrack to boot.  So many good memories!

Yeah, I know tons of Christian nutballs. As for whether or not I've studied modern Christianity, yes. I used to go to a religious school, until fifth grade (six years ago). I was doubting the religion in the final years, and once I was out and had some time to breath, I realized what bullshit it really was. And any time. I like a good discussion. (And any hint on how you got the linebreaks that time? I've put several in here, but I doubt they will show up. Dammit.)
agreed, sir. agreed.
Methodological naturalism means by default rejecting the supernatural as a regular, reliable causal component in observed phenomenal patterns. This is an underpinning principle on which science is based. In other words, the supernatural is denied in a certain way, in certain contexts.

And there is a *disagreement* here on whether the government is the source of all of those problems. Libertarians assert that, but somehow fail to show me the stable admirable society with no government. Where is the society that solved the problems of bigotry and poverty without resorting to government actions?

They do have flashing light alarms/notifications, but that won't likely help if you are asleep.  They also have things that shake the bed for alarms or doorbells or what-have-you, but if you have that set up for something else you may not differentiate that this is *important.*  Not saying this is the best idea though.
Miranda was probably my favorite new character. Really though, almost all of the characters in this game are better than their ME1 counterparts.  Having said that, I thought the returning squad mates were the most interesting. Garrus and Tali were both kinda dull in the first game, but really captivating in this one.
Ah, thanks, didn't see that. Even lamer than I thought. If it was released as an XP theme that'd be alright, but to give it a logo and splash screen and name it something completely new? Lame. 
Fool.  1/60th of an hour.
According to Christianity, we all really suck at being "good people," but like to claim to others that we don't.
Wouldn't ignorance and poverty cause the people to be bad at praying, too?  They would pray for immediate needs to be fulfilled rather than long-term goals, eh?  Or they would pray that god would build them a dome stadium instead of a world-class public transportation system.
Well, there would be strict standards and goals that the private companies would need to adhere to/meet in order to maintain their permit to operate.

Politically despicable in the sense that they are nothing more than hired guns for the largest bidder. Today they are supporting the US, tomorrow someone else may pay them more to oppose US troops. That is what mercenaries are, and they (mercenaries) are pretty universally reviled around the world for a reason.   They want to support US armed forces in clandestine operations and protect civilian employees? Join the freaking military and do it right.

They've had new episodes since then. I haven't seen most of them personally because I've had about enough of Williams Street's whacked-out shows, but they've had about 20 since then and another set of new ones start next Sunday. There was supposedly an episode that was a take-off of the whole Boston thing that got spiked by some executive somewhere and hasn't been seen.

&gt;second, how do you say "we cant get rid of our problems by finding a new place" without first realizing that our place we live in now is in fact, full of problems?, and that finding a new place would actually be beneficial since our place apparently has so many problems? do you think before you speak?  unless you think we'll be colonizing the galaxy within the next hundred years or so....no, "jumping ship" is absolutely not a viable option at this point. We'll have widespread disease/starvation/poverty long before then unless we put forth adequate thought and resources toward maintaining a sustainable existence on Earth.  and i'm glad you've taken the time to look at my comments. feel free to respond to the posts you've found to your disliking.  i can't say that i've taken the time to scour your post history, but from what i'm seeing here i think you could also use a bit of improvement.

And that's what makes it tough; we don't hear much of the athletes and their personal problems once they retire and don't know about rugby, but the NFL in the usa tried to discredit the doctor's research when he first came up with it because the NFL didn't want to pay medical costs for this player.

Right and I think the problem a lot of people have, is sexism against men is a lot subtler and less obvious, in many cases, than sexism agaisnt women. Gender roles about men can often be perceived as positive things, who wouldn't want to be see as strong family man who protects his women. Due to this negative consequences of it are often overlooked, what about the sensitive boy who cries when bad things happen to him and is ridiculed because of it? What of the father who wants to take time off work to raise his child?   Both genders can get too caught up in blaming the other gender for their problems, when it's the same problem plaguing both of them.

He makes the rules. In general  I am encouraged to ask for what I want, but I wont get it, at least not when I ask for it.  I only get to have sex when he says I can. I can masturbate unless he tells me I am not allowed to.  I need to offer my ass or neck when I want this attention. I am only allowed to cum when he tells me to (although I often brake this one, and get punished for it)
It's merely playing the low E open, then on the first fret, then 2-3-4 on the A in between up and down.  You don't have to pick any faster then most of the intro stuff honestly the hardest part is making sure your fretting hand is keeping up with your picking.  
Rereading my post again, I think that I somewhat misrepresented my idea.  I wanted to say that maybe the constants are not really different parts of a jigsaw puzzle that happened to be right.  That's to say that the constants are inter-related and not separate as they are often thought of.  This inter-relation of the constants brings about their seemingly puzzling compatibility.  Also, I have come to realize the my "pi" example is not a good representative for my specific case, albeit it could be used against the fine-tuning of the universe in a different context.

Using your argument then it is fair to call the other side pro-abortion.  Or do you not see that aspect of the argument?  They aren't anti-choice, they are anti-abortion.  Let's put this in another format.  If I am against murder, am I anti-choice or anti-murder?  They believe that abortion is killing a baby.  They may, or may not, be correct.  But that is what they believe.  They aren't against choice.  They are against abortion.  Anti-abortion is a fair term.  As long as you call the other side pro-abortion.  The truth of the matter is that pro-choice is the preferred term for the pro-abortion side and pro-life is the preferred term for the anti-abortion side.  If you find yourself using EITHER of the non-preferred terms then you aren't able to approach the discussion neutrally.

The very existence of the "vicitms" you feign empathy for is because of the power of capitalism to produce far more than any other system.  Without it, most of them would have starved long ago.

Irrelevant. You still embrace the whole idea of someone becoming a soldier to be some epitome for selflessness for the greater good of everyone else. It's this kind of mindset that causes good, albeit ignorant, people to leave their homes and accidentally shoot an unarmed civilian in a "suspicious looking house". We too (a nameless European state) have a military presence in Afghanistan, yet I don't see anyone around me cheerfully screaming in glee for the morons that chose to transfer there (AFAIK, you can't be forced to leave the country unless it is in a full-scale war). Matter of the fact is, those people are quite frowned upon and rightly so. If your government chooses to jump the bandwagon and run rampaging into a foreign country, the last thing a well-intentioned citizen should do is join the very armed forces that are carrying out these fanciful tasks.
It's not about playing against Israel, I don't know if anyone can "win" that game, it's about playing towards others. It's about playing to the media. It's about sidestepping direct confrontation.

It's in Luke: "Three days later his parents found Him in the temple, sitting with teachers, listening to them and asking them questions. Those listening were "astonished" at how he understood and answered. His parents were amazed and his mother said to him, “Why did you run away for three days?  Your father and I looked for you and were anxious.”   It hardly says that "doctors were amazed at his ability to converse on advanced concepts".  It basically says Jesus disobeyed his parents, ran off for three days, and was found in a temple talking to the religious teachers.   Whoop-de-doo.   You don't think temple clergy would talk to a lost kid?  I think they would, and they probably taught him a fair bit of dogma if he were there for three days, that his parents might be "amazed" at.  He was, after all, a religous schizotypal personality. 
Your reasoning is full of strawmen, baseless assumptions, displays a complete lack of perspective and is otherwise so utterly without merit that I feel engaging you would be like arguing with a can of pudding. Pudding is for eating (and later pooping out) but that is about it.

To me, shopping at thrift stores is endlessly entertaining. It's like antiquing, or going to garage sales -- you never know what you're going to find, and when you find something really great, it feels fantastic. Going to a store and buying something new out of a rack of similar items, when you know you'll be seeing it walking down the street every day, doesn't have nearly the same feeling. More fun, less money, what's to lose?

Except that is not anything that I believe. In fact, I have strongly disagree with less government. I don't mind a government providing large-scale programs to redistribute wealth to those that need it, not to wealthy corporations and their executive boards.  I think the government should be big and provide people with social programs.  I also don't think God has jackshit to do with anything.   "To bring about less government, more responsibility, and — with God’s help — a better world by providing leadership, education, and organized volunteer action in accordance with moral and Constitutional principles."  Pass on that.
Well then I don't believe we can really continue this debate. We can't even agree on the language.    Being able to voluntarily and permanently leave at will does not a slave make, no matter how many definitions and *degrees* of liberty you want to play around with.

There was little enough bigotry in 1680s Pennsylvania, which, seeing as they basically told Penn he could go fuck himself with his regulations, was pretty much anarchic. Juries were always half-Indian.  I can't speak to poverty, but the only way relative poverty will be eliminated is by reducing humanity to a primitive hunter-gatherer society. Poverty, like wealth, is relative.  The only source I have on the Pennsylvanian anarchy is "Conceived in Liberty," by Murray Rothbard.

By "no friends", do you mean people who you feel that you can bond with, or just that you haven't even made casual acquaintances?

&gt;Are you basically desensitized to nudity now?  Yeah, pretty much.

Maybe 10-15%?  &gt;Do you get boners at hot nudists?  I've never had a boner = (  &gt;Do you get turned on by a naked woman still? Or do you need more in terms of emotional stimulation?  Well, for starters I am a girl, but I think working there made me appreciate the female form more, and it also made me feel super hot comparatively speaking.

Funny thing is, the day of the fire I ran out of the house so fast I didn't even have a pair of shoes.  Keep in mind this was in December in Chicago and below zero.  When you are in that situation you have NO TIME to grab anything.  Smoke will fill your home so fast it's not even funny.  So, if it ever happens to you in the future just get the hell out of there.  As for new clothes, my Dad went shopping the following morning and Kohls was very helpful.  My Dad didn't know what size my Mom was so he just described her figure to the saleswoman and she helped pick out the basic essentials for my Mom.  Kohls also let my parents and I pick out any coat we wanted in the store to replace ones that we had lost.

A donkey vote is just writing 1,2,3,4.. on the ballot, as far as the people counting the vote are concerned its legitimate, so nothing unusual happens.  I see you've edited the question to say 'non-vote' which is the same as an informal vote (writing "I like boobs" on the ballot for example). If that is what you mean then it is the same as not voting, only the 'formal' votes are counted as usual. It doesn't matter if 60% of people lodge informal ballots (its usually 3% or something), the 40% will be counted.  If your question is 'what if *everybody* lodges an informal vote', well then there are constitutional provisions for such an eventuality. Section 27c of the constitution requires that we dress the governor general up in a winged pig suit and throw him/her off the Sydney Harbour Bridge.. so we're basically covered. ;)

I guess I don't understand your criticism. Democratic Socialist states seem to be doing just fine in Europe.   I fail to see what has differentiated capitalism from all the perils you seem to mention. The death of millions? The utter destruction of native cultures? Yeah, you haven't pointed out anything that is unique to socialism. Your perception of who does what wrong seems a bit startling and silly.   I wasn't looking for insults, but a pleasant discussion.

you're such a stereotypical liberal. 
This has come up twice now and obviously needs some clarification: I said conservatives *value* work ethic, business sense, and sound financial decisions, not that they always *adhere to those values.*  &gt; I wonder what conservative personalities like Rush Limbaugh, Hannity, Glenn Beck, Bill O'Reilly, Ann Coulter and may many others are doing (and quite successfully) in show businness ?  They're in show business (well, all of them except Ann Coulter, who's an author with several TV appearances), yes, but none of the people you mentioned are particularly creative, now are they? Limbaugh's only real creative endeavor is finding a way to be more obnoxious every day.... And in fact that statement applies to all of them. Their only artistic contribution is reaffirming the conservative worldview.
I'm sure you don't.
We had a few ladies who were exhibitionists, and they would really push the limits.  We had a few women touch themselves in public, and once when I was cocktail serving in the night club a guy just started going down on his woman.  It was really funny.  
Great question.  I would have to say balanced? But to be fair I do make beats, play guitar, listen to hip hop (since I was little). I'm slightly a black white boy in that I am fairly steeped in black things (culture/music) That is not to say I'm not steeped in white culture as well. To be clear, I don't dress like a  'wigger' or talk in Ebonics AT ALL  Conversely, she isn't 'black girl' by the United States white person stereotype. She grew up around mostly white people but she was, for example, raised by her grandmother because her mother was very young when she was born.   I can't say our relationship is as dichotomous as 'suburban white-boy' meet 'inner city black girl'...that ama would probably be more interesting!

I'm not being disingenuous, and I don't have a chip on my shoulder. *In my opinion*, he's an undervalued author who's written books that compare favorably to those of the literary greats. I spent four years in college reading Fitzgerald and analyzing the heck out of Hemingway. And—here's that sticky phrase again—my opinion is that King's characters are more true to life and vibrant than most. His characterization is wonderful.   He does some things poorly. He has a tendency to rush his endings and to go for pathos (and *deus ex machina*) over substance. But I disagree that his flaws override his strengths, and I do not feel that a writer's genre should be taken into consideration when judging his talent.  I don't care whether he's considered either important or influential even a tiny little bit.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denim#Dry_denim  Its generally better quality when you buy it, though it does cost a lot more. Basically, it is unwashed, and the point is to break it in to match your usage. Most people don't recommend washing them, if so only once every several months.
Oftentimes you may have great chemistry with someone in person, but they don't communicate the same way that you do / want them to when you're apart.  It's pretty clear that she's either too busy to keep in touch or simply just doesn't communicate the same way that you do. You can either decide that the chemistry that you have when you see her is worth not being able to get a hold of her for now, or decide that this is important to you and move on.  My guess is that if you send her a text saying "hey - been trying to get together with you but have had no luck. ball's in your court, hope to hear from you", and then wait a while, she'll get in touch with you. If not, then oh well.  Don't be angry in the text, though -- she's not obligated to get in touch with you, your expectations are simply out of sync with hers. Sending something angry will weird her out.
Does this mean your boat sank, and you pulled it up by the anchor?

&gt;Bogus source in my opinion as I can't even find their methodology, you should go beyond a simple google search next time.   I stuck to a simple Google search for a simple reason:  the source I submitted is pretty much in line with any other mainstream source you could care to provide.  Feel free to conduct your own search:  you will find that Japan is usually placed near the bottom of the top ten military powers in the world.  &gt;China is very much on par with Japan when it comes to current military technology.  The bulk of China's military is, frankly, obsolete.  While they have been busy modernizing their forces, the fact remains that only a small core of China's military has been brought up to current standards.  &gt;China clearly dominates Japan  Not quite yet, but definitely in the near future as China continues to modernize its forces.  Regardless, saying that Japan does not have a significant military in its own right is downright wrong. 
Who is that? Not the mudkip, the girl with the chainsaw?
I think it will make a stronger impact if you don't say anything to her.  Sending an ultimatum signals that you're still available, but why do you want to be available to someone who mistreats you. Continuing will just teach her that you are okay with being mistreated. 
Perhaps, but I'm voting Pot Pie in #1.
I like it because it's really light on the CPU, fairly customizable in terms of UI and how your library is organized, and keeps the library updated to the second (I've been pissed off by media players that require re-syncs whenever you move a file, I don't recall if winamp was guilty of this).  The reason i switched to foobar after winamp was mostly the light CPU usage, winamp got heavy and slow for me now and then.
 yeah i think so
For $500 plus, I should damn well be able to play anything I want on it.  Why is anybody going to pay more for less?

actually, it applies both ways, although I've never seen it used in the context that you're using.  reference: I immigrated to the US along with my family, and I live in an area where Asians are a majority, where there are many first and second generation kids. It's a somewhat "common" topic throughout my life here in the states. 
I agree. The double tap of the apple is unnecessary, but I wanted this to be realistic and not infringe on Steve Job's war on moving parts. But it is all up to the developers and the public to make the iPad work.

I honestly think it's laughable for me to attempt to define the USSR in one word or for you to define socialism in a single sentence.  I, personally, think that socialism is an ideology that has implications for areas much broader than just the economy. EDIT: **That is, what socialism dictates necessitates a certain power structure: one that is, for one, not totalitarian in nature. In this sense, I think it's fair to oppose socialism with totalitarianism.**  In any case, the economy present in the USSR in no way resembled a socialist economy. For one, most wealth was owned by handful of oligarchs, party leaders (or whatever you wish to call them) who masqueraded as Communists, as opposed to a socialist economy which would require equal access to wealth for the entire society.  Regardless of whether socialism is at all possible, the USSR was not it.
Makes for a moving target if people arrive at multiple times.  Then again, cell phones.

PA, and specifically, her husband left her. She tried to kill herself, and the little psych ward decided she needed long term help so they transferred her to Danville state.
There were a lot of people with kids that hung out there.  There were a lot of families that lived there.  We would usually have one or 2 families a weekend which is not a lot compared to how many people were there.
I'm a server and also fairly new to reddit. Since I've been on I've seen a *ton* of topics about servers and restaurant behavior.
How does the bail bond thing work?  Everything I know about Bail Bonds, I learned from watching a few episodes of "Dog the Bounty Hunter". :)  Sooo...  you needed $100k to get out of jail.  You pay the bail bond place $15k and they put up $100k to the jail? So the bail bond place gets $15k, then if you show up to the court date, they get their $100k back.  Is that correct?  Since you didn't show up, the bail bond place is out $85k.  Several people in this thread were saying "oh, don't worry.. the bail bond place doesn't have to pay out $100k" -- but they DID have to pay that for you to get out, yes?  So.. back to Dog the Bounty Hunter...  this bail bond place has their own guys, or hires out somebody like Dog, to look for you???  And then if Dog finds you and brings you in, the jail municipality gives the $100k back to the bail bond place... and the bail bond place gives a portion of this $100k to Dog.    Is that how it works??  
The thing is... the real thing will actually be possible soon enough to where the fiction will be pointless aside from being somewhat prophetic material. Otherwise, it'll just be more interesting to see what happens for real.

HERE I COME TO ATTACK YOU WITH MY MULTIPLE ACCOUNTS   *downvote downvote pew pew pew*
[this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_skating#How_it_works) kind of explains how ice always has a very thin layer of liquid water on it.    Also, what's the surface area of the blade's edge that touches the ice?  If you took someone like me at 845 Newtons and put it over a very small area, say .1 cm^2 i would have the pressure of 835 atmospheres.    At my weight, if the area of the blade contacting the ice is .013 cm^2, i would produce enough pressure to melt ice.  So yeah..what's the surface area of an ice skate blade?

Much of Africa is, most of the time, peaceful. I have visited many African countries and I'd point to Ghana as a reasonably run peaceful nation.

It's too bad that op is seeing so many downvotes for this post.

just because you say so? i don't think so.
I have to disagree. I really like Phish and I enjoy some String cheese and I've never seen any of them live. My all time favourite band is the Grateful Dead who I've never seen but I can listen to live shows endlessly for days on end. I just love adventurous music without a net that goes places even the musicians never expected.   Just to clarify- the reason I've never seen them live is because they've never come to Australia. God I wish they had.
Oh, sure, I'm going to fold someone else's clothes. I barely even fold *my own* clothes. No, it's far more reasonable to just expect someone to take their crap out within a few minutes after it's done, not that I should fold their clothes if I have a problem with him/her (usually her) taking her sweet ass time. Why reward bad behavior with a favor?

My teeth are terrible, I'm constantly getting cavities and having to fill them. I wasn't preached at about cavities since I was a little kid, so I thought the problem just went away and I forgot about it. But I realized that even with regular brushing, sodas were murdering my teeth. Another perk that I look forward to, even though I'm sure a lot of damage has been caused already.

If the screen would support touch sensitivity like the touchpads on the macbooks do....my goodness it would be amazing. Two finger tap on the screen for all apps to display, flicks for closing apps (like on the palm pre).
I think you would have to have the main character/narrator be Johnny, and just have him go through all the stuff, but even then, it wouldn't work out very well. especially the stuff that isn't filmed in the book, and is just kinda talked about.
Sweet!  Nice work.
Their jobs are different, but in terms of education they're surprisingly similar. Vet school is ludicrously hard to get into (quite a bit harder than medical school, actually), costs an arm and a leg, and shoves its students out the door with massive debt into low-wage jobs. Medicine between humans and animals isn't as different as you might think.  The big differences are that veterinarians are rarely sued for malpractice, people are willing to spend more to save their own lives than their pets', and there is very little veterinary insurance out there.  Not that doctors don't deserve more, they're obviously working in a much higher risk and higher stress environment.
I moved.  Wasn't well received at a new school.
Good idea. Thank you for the suggestion.
Nice try except wouldn't a benevolent god forgive stupidity (he made them that way). What precludes the "ignorant" from praying for "long-term goals". How would something immediate differ from long-term (does god have a stopwatch?). All prayers are asking for something (except thank you prayers) concrete or abstract which manifest physically. i.e. I was shot in the head, but that is immediate so god wouldn't answer.
going a half mile to 6 miles in the span of a month with a totally new gait seems a bit too fast. I would try again but much slower.

A few minutes of googling would yield a seemingly smart question, but that's not my objective. For that matter, I don't even have to ask a question. My objective, however, is to ask something many people are curious/concerned about; I'd rather take full advantage of an opportunity presented to me, rather than waste it. If I can ask a question many people want to know the answer to and relay his answer back to a public forum for everyone to see, why not?
Anarchist communism is just communism, but with different tactics. The "end stage" is identical to the Marxist "end stage", but the means used to achieve that are widely divergent. This is why anarchists and Marxist communists worked together in the First Internationale.

Whales are highly intelligent, and appear to be sentient based on observations and studies so far. We don't tolerate humans killing humans, particularly for cannibalism, so why should we tolerate the killing of other intelligent and sentient species such as Whales, Dolphins, Great Apes, etc?   Is everything less intelligent and less sentient than us free game? I don't think people will like that position if a more advanced and more intelligent extraterrestrial species came here and decided to eat us.   I think we should endeavour to avoid killing other intelligent species unless we absolutely have to (e.g. starvation). 
1-dimension is nothing but a point. And, anything between two points would be...a line. Time is nothing but motion. The construction of the geometry of a point, or a line, mathematically, does not require time. To construct a point or a line in 3-dimensional, Euclidean, space, of course, [does].

No, you deleted it because you have some sort of "I need to be validated by others, and all responses to my opinions *must* be positive" complex.

Comment karma's just a number, and if you let that number prompt you into censoring yourself, then you're a fucking coward.

But isn't the very act of manufacturing plastic tying up carbon?  Making more plastic is using up carbon but NOT releasing it into the atmosphere.  And I know for a fact that if I buy a piece of wood, a tree gets cut down, the forest regenerates (absorbing more carbon), and the net effect is that an amount of carbon equal to the wood is sequestered.  If I buy a plastic bottle or a piece of wood and keep it in my basement for 100 years, that carbon is not going into the atmosphere.

Luckily those types of issues are rare.

It's not true that the distress in America comes from ignorance of money and credit. That statement is beyond ludicrous. It is from the lack of honor and virtue of those granted power by the people. Capitalism has nothing to do with it. America was founded on the principle of blaming the underclass for everything, all liars do this. It is the great undying tradition in America. John Adams was completely wrong and was not a hero, he was one of those who started the oppression of Americans and founded it's traditions, one of which is the technique of BLAMING THE VICTIM.

It doesn't. You gain the votes of the winners, you lose the votes of the losers.

Meanwhile, you gain my vote.  Seems like a wash, vote-wise.

If your opinion is correct, congrats google exists.  You are done.  The reason why keyword is good is because right now the title is all reddit has.  A keyword list allows people to put whatever they want in the title and people can still find it. Say it's something about haiti and someone calls is it "OMG look at these people fail."  Currently searching haiti would never find that.  The only way to fix that is with relevant keywords.  Searching comments does not fix that as comments could say anything.  Relying on random comments to make search work is just stupid.  It makes no sense.

One experience was wierd. I went in for suicide ideation, and was there for about a week when I blacked out. They were trying to get a good sliding scale for my type 1 diabetes. Anyways I blacked out for 2 whole days. Not sure why, if it was the pills I was getting, or If I was in a hypoglycemic episode.    It was wierd I came to in the middle of the day watching TV and was freaking out because I had no memory of the last two days.. Didn't want to tell them I basically blacked out so I never did find out the cause of it. They told me I was stripping in front of every and doing all sorts of wierd things. Anyways spent another week there before they would discharge me.

[Nope, or at least not visible](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/awgfw/i_worked_at_a_nudist_resort_for_2_years_ama/c0jr1le?context=1). Although the places you want do exist, the more official nudism is not what you expect
The other question is who makes more money in the form of increased tax revenues when all of these wages inflate? The people who set the minimum wage.

And I just wet myself in fear.
New York. I found a method which looks good using a pin, bottle cap, and a cup. Light, blow out, let smoke fill cup, suck out with a bendy-straw. How big of a pinch should I use at first, like a half a pinkie nail?  I had to laugh when I found this, because it is so many years later...my friend used to find random shit like this in his pockets all the *time*. Even after coming home from the airport. Which was scary, but funny. We had a bit of a falling out, which I'm bummed about, otherwise I'd call him about this. He's still in Germany, I think.
Thanks!

While it would be exactly what he deserves, lowering themselves to his level isn't going to do anything good. I think it would send a better message if the funeral was just ignored.  Hatefully celebrating the death of a hatemonger just doesn't make any sense.

The real concern for me with this particular car would be the stock transmission and all that non-stock torque going through it.   Dent Sport Garage has a good reputation so I imagine anything they have done, ie the engine rebuild / tune, is very good. 
I'm not sure why anyone calling themselves "friends" would do this.
That would be awesome - Thanks a ton!!
Regarding the additional content, I meant that I edited the post (my post) above this.  I simply said this to be polite, in case you were replying to the original post.  It's not a big deal.  Regarding your opinion that King trumps, or is equivalent to the likes of Hemingway or Fitzgerald, I ***guarantee*** you that King himself disagrees with you.  But hey!  That's just **his** opinion, eh?  What does he know?  /not holding my breath waiting for King to win a Nobel Prize for Literature

With no natural predators worth mentioning, why would humans continue to evolve?  The only driving factors will be cultural differences driving population rates (including the idiocracy effect) that may lead to changes in pigment or intelligence.  But there is no reason to evolve a 6th finger or anything.

It didn't have to be your girlfriend or wife.  I think it was just to ensure it wasn't a complete sausage fest.  There were more guys than girls around.  
I'd imagine that these women did this repeatedly. Would you guys deal with them the same way that you'd deal with men? When confronted, were they apologetic or defensive?

Realtors fees were still pretty high, but trading costs between banks for MBSs were tiny.  And since buyers could get 110% loans to pay the fees, it didn't really matter.  There weren't actually massive price fluctuations, either.  There was one enormous unsustainable price rise, followed by a corresponding fall.  Over 10 years.
You are severely downplaying how modern Chinas military has become.  It is not the 1990s anymore.  Anyway, Japans actually military capability, right now is rather limited.  But if it wanted it could easily become a dominate, wide ranging force.  That is is the issue at hand.  China does not want Japan to fully militarize, because it knows it could instantly be a major threat.  But as it stands right now Japans military is not suited for anything other than defensive action.
Hahahahaha that's fantastic. The octopus may be too Spongebob for a tatt, but that's hilarious nonetheless. :)
I agree about the throwaway culture issues, but the impact on greenhouse gasses is positive.  If we took all of the plastic bottles and just built big plastic bricks out of them made buildings out of them, every new plastic bottle created would be an additional amount of carbon tied up.  There's a lot of cutting-edge research going on about how to trap carbon in solid form, by seeding algae with iron or pumping it underground.  There has to be a reason why it is carbon-negative, but I don't see it.

Hey, that's cool!  Just a thought, if you are still in the design stage, the underlying sketchup linework could be rendered as a "pencil sketch" linetype to convey to the client that the design isn't permanent yet.  Or there is a feature to extend the lines at intersections, if you know the rendering style I mean. 
It was regular soda, I was drinking so much HFCS that sodas sweetened with a diet sugar substitute like aspartame tastes terrible. Even the "throwback" sodas that Pepsi is making with real sugar tasted off to me, I liked the corn syrup (but alternative sodas like Jones with cane sugar tasted fine, I guess I just don't like the classic "soda" taste without corn syrup).  I don't know what the deal with the caffeine was, but I've always had a very different reaction to the caffeine in sodas and the caffeine in coffee. Sodas won't make me awake or tired, and I can go right to sleep after drinking one. Coffee will give me a caffeine high, though, with a lot of shaking and inability to sleep followed by a steep crash.  Maybe I was having withdrawals from all of the sugar. But I'm no kind of dietitian, I don't know what was in the stuff, I just drank it.

But then you would restrict the amount of gestures available in apps. In games like Skee Ball (I am assuming you have or have used an iPod Touch/iPhone), a flick is the core of the game...

But the maximum prison period was established for the worst case scenario. Just because he committed the same crime doesn't mean he'll get the same sentence; the law can't handle specific situations, so it has to be established in a way that can handle almost all scenarios at a judge's discretion.

Ok, now we're fighting about it.   Because she started and she was doing great and then just stopped texting me altogether. Like no we're done. Or I gotta do something, just stopped after a text.   Because she "isn't as good as me".

I'm guessing you've never watched the wire or lost? I've never seen deadwood but I wanna check it out.   ...   My favorites are (in order) LOST -&gt; the wire -&gt; battlestar galactica(going through the series now but it's damn good.).  There are many more but others have been mentioned or I'm sure will be. 
I'm finding this funnier than I should. Everyone in the game is just pissed off that they can't see anything through all the smoke, and keep burning to death. I'd buy it for a dollar.

I like to appreciate the things people will do in total sincerity, like going to foreign countries with no amenities and trying to help people that don't want them there.  There have been things they've helped with, things they've fucked up and I think that's its own discussion.  I appreciate their sincerity and their will-power.  I disagree with saving nations when our own needs a lot of work.  I also agree with the idea that soldiers are trained to kill, they are not trained to save lives, that may be a side effect of the killing.  Killing is, however, their job.  That may be really simple minded, but that's what a military does.
.... you mean Major Motoko Kusanagi?
The military is not a social experiment.

Major Motoko Kusanagi.
He hit a female (glasses-wearing) TRU store director in the face with a pie. It was intended for a girl he had had a fight with but he just didn't have the heart to do it to her. He had the pie in hand, in the store and used the company phone in one of the aisle. He called the director to a certain area and waited. When she turned the corner, WHAM! the pie tin touched her nose. He didn't run, he just let what was left of the pie fall to the ground and walked out. The store director deserved it because she put him on a "no-rehire" list.
He's Steve Jobs, obviously.
You *don't* check reddit every half hour? You, sir, are an embarrassment and should be embarrassed.
They killed the 4th movie with Crichton (well, they didn't kill him, but you know) - it's not likely there will be any additional storyline without him.
... and was just depressed that someone else had beaten him to it.
ah yes, the delicate give and take of drug use.
great advice; simple and to the point.
&gt; Side note - six months later, the biggest complainer and person who pretended I didn't exist ended up working with me on a project and getting along with me pretty well.  That's how pretty much everyone is, if they allow themselves to get to know someone that they are "afraid" of.  I think most people who hate GLBT, or find us offensive, don't actually know any of us.
The girl is wearing a hoody - hardly scanitily-clad in my book. I wouldn't notice any weird looks when using the netbook anyway - once it's open I pretty much stay glued to the screen.
Thank you for that.  I'm definitely going to keep your advice in mind.  The students who will be in my classes aren't paid to be there.  They actually have to sign up and are selected on a case-by-case basis.  Hopefully that will lead to more motivated students.  They also need to have a high school diploma for this particular class. GED classes are offered to those who don't have one.    &gt;You are dealing with people who have had a very different life than you.  I'm definitely going to keep this in mind.  Thanks again for the advice.

I agree on not using a secondary with wheats. As far as when to rack to secondary with most of my ales I just wait till a couple of days after the krausen falls and the top is fairly clear, it usually takes a week or two. I rarely take gravity readings until right before kegging so that I can get an og.  
Keep in mind that there can be such a thing as too clean when it comes to full suspension bikes. Do your best to keep water out of the pivots/bearings/bushings.

There's an stigma in nudism in USA against the single male, as those are usually the ones who're supposed to go with strictly pervy purposes.  If you're acouple, you're a-ok. If you're a single woman, you're a-ok. But if you're a single male you're suspected right away. That's one problem i have against organized nudism in the USA.

It's weird.  I had never even heard about this show until I stumbled across some DVDs at a Best Buy last time I was in the US.  I like DeVito, but didn't want to buy it because I'd never heard anything about it.  Worth checking out?
When I lived there, 20,000 ~ 30,000 people; I remember it being a big deal when we got our first bus, which ran every 4 hours.
I think when you look at the support they already have from Iran and Russia and sometimes China, and the long standing refusal to cooperate or worse, intentional deception from Britain, USA, Israel and the United Nations, it's pretty easy to see why Hamas rolls the way they do.   Every now and then they will test the waters to see if Israel feels like playing fair.. and about two or three weeks after Israel pulls a stunt that reminds them you don't negotiate with them, you kill them until they are all dead, because that's what they have in store for you.  It's a shit situation with a lot of innocents being killed and we are backing the wrong team. That doesn't make Hamas a bunch of sweet little Angels, but I understand that Israel left them no other choices after a long and ragged history of deceit, betrayal and genocide.
- There's this idea that if you don't read books, you're an anti-intellectual moron.  While that may be true for most people, I rather get my information from WWWebsites like Wikipedia or Reddit.

&gt;Just because they support something doesn't mean you should feel bad for supporting Palestine.  I don't - I guess I should have been more clear about that.  It's just that agreeing with a neo-nazi is a position I never thought I'd be in.

I still think the greatest difficulty an organizer would face is getting employees to talk to them. The obstacle would be convincing employees that they would not be fired for discussing organization.
Ok, my brain is really working slowly today. I read your onomatopoeia initially as Schick, schick, schick, and I got an image of women shaving their kooters around the pool.
&gt;But as it stands right now Japans military is not suited for anything other than defensive action.  A military existing primarily for the purpose of domestic defence?  What a novel concept!  But in all seriousness:  &gt;You are severely downplaying how modern Chinas military has become.  Doubtful.  While Rumsfeld enjoyed playing up the threat of the Yellow Peril, the Chinese military does have a long way to go before it can become an effective **offensive** force.  They have loads of troops and weapons, but would be unable to send them to Taiwan, let alone Japan or some other overseas destination.  So far, it appears that China's primary focus in its modernization has been on defence and assymitrical forces to deter attack from stronger (ie, the US) militaries.  Japan has little to fear until China develops an effective blue water navy.

...your scenario fails to recognize the obvious; getting yourself into that position smacks of shortsightedness and ignorance.  Having one unexpected child is an accident; anything more than that indicates a pattern of idiocy.  Past that, it isn't particularly hard to feed a family of four on welfare or minimum wage.  There are plenty of high-calorie junk foods that are cheap and that's exactly what many children live on.  Don't bother responding.  It's quite obvious that you can't see the forest for the trees.

Yeah, I like *Red*, too.  To get the full effect of the ending, though (and let's not give it away) you ought to watch them in the order they were made: *Bleu*, *Blanc*, *Rouge*.  Great, great films.  They're not in French, but after seeing the Trois Couleurs you'll want to watch [*Dekalog*](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0092337/) -- it's world-rockingly amazing.  Why did Kieslowski have to die, dammit?
Very yes.
That's just odd, the only times I have blacked out were from drugs and/or drinking.
Do it!
I must also give credit to luck. It could easily have gone much, much worse.
Yes, best show on television.
Why assume I have not watched those?  Why not just assume Deadwood is my chosen favorite?  The Wire is ok but I never got into it.  I LOVE OZ too.  But Deadwood is something else entirely.  It is wonderfully written and acted.  I think Deadwood is better than any movie I have ever seen.  Not just television.  I hate Lost and find it retarded.

Wow, I didn't realize I was talking to a full on retard.  Anyone that graduated elementary school would know I just referred to *you* as a girl, not myself.  Interesting you bring up homosexuals though, a little bit of transference (a psychology term, you are probably too stupid to realize what I'm talking about but I refuse to coddle you just because you are "slow witted")?  I suggest you call your wet nurse down to read this to you and translate it into something more manageable for your three functioning brain cells to understand.  I'd say call your mom down but it was probably her whoring for crack money that made you retarded in the first place.  Sad, sad world you live in.
6 months of wedging.   The transaxle is from a later year Porsche 944 Turbo (951).  It can handle the torque (HP keeps you there, torque is what you feel).  I had to replace the 951 transaxle 5th gear with the 944 5th gear to make for some good "overdrive" gearing for the highway.  
That makes sense. I stand corrected.

With mobile devices and embedded programming projects you probably will hear about space/time trades a lot and you should consider it when designing your app. In time-critical apps the dynamic loading later could be an issue.

True. I was putting it in terms that Anon1991 could understand.

Sweet, I have the same wallpaper in my rotation.  In fact, it's up right now!
The Stig actually used to be [black](http://indianautosblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/black-stig.jpg).  Perhaps this is his new profession after having driven off of an [aircraft carrier](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Stig#Black_Stig).
and that is why you are where you are..  *yawn*
Ah, a detail I thoughtlessly neglected.  I live in Brooklyn.  I've edited my post as well.  I know of a few stores that have a wide array of beers so I'll make a note of all the beers you mentioned.  Lots of bars around here have Sierra Nevada on tap.  It's not really my thing but I find myself ordering it from time to time anyway.  It's like I like it enough to always want to give it a second chance.  Which reminds me, it's about due for another try, haha.
Sounds Awesome!!   Mine was pretty average. I had a babysitter but was broke so I did nothng :(
It kind of hinged on the idea of a material that was both a semiconductor, and caused total internal refraction.  The point would be computing in base-4, rather than base-2. It'd be easier to communicate digitally wet computing concepts... Using DNA as a storage medium, and such.  I never said *that* idea was great, but it was a crazy idea.
Having the balls to say something back isn't being a prick about it, it's standing up for yourself.
Oh they are creative. They create a lot of fear, hate, bigotry, lies. They do it masterfully, they show a fine commandment of a language. Ann Coulter writes lots of books. It's just as i said, they can't find a material for ridicule. Because the moment they try to do it, they end up ridiculing themselves. 
and [this](http://imgur.com/EciF7.jpg) one?
i prefer to think of it as sort of fulfilling its purpose.
SPOILERS AS WELL  Same thing happened to me. It was confusing as hell so I reloaded to see if I missed something. Nope, they just said "take the shuttle to your next mission" right after I got the IFF, but it wouldn't actually let me go on any mission. The crew got abducted and then the heroes came back. I'm not too sure why this happens sometimes, because on a subsequent playthrough I got to go on a mission/travel to another system after acquiring the IFF. Might be a bug.
You heard right.  It was a joint production with the BBC.  After two seasons, the BBC wouldn't pony up their share ($50M!) for a third season, and HBO were not willing to pay for it all themselves, due to lacklustre returns.  They destroyed the sets.  I heard that HBO subsequently regretted their decision, as it has become very popular on DVD and has sold well internationally.
Where did you get that CAPITAAAH! sticker?
Sorry, but there seems to be a 8 minute delay before I can respond...reddit never used to do this regarding comments. Is this something new?  By our 3-dimensional state we are forced to describe all dimensional states less than, or greater, than that, in terms of 3-dimensions + time. Therein, lies the difficulty.  Well, I am an old man, I have to sleep now, it's way, way past my bed time, but feel free to rattle my chain any time.
That's strange. From my perspective, 20,000 ~ 30,000 is huge.   What do you do in Vancouver?

How "[natural](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appeal_to_nature)" is it to live in a house with a yard anyway? Everything we do upsets the original course of nature -- to good or bad ends. You like birds, so feeding cats is a bad thing for you. The OP likes cats, so feeding cats is a good thing for her. Neither of your preferences is objectively correct.
Haha, so true.
Wow, ok this one gets a story too.  It was a holiday weekend and there were a ton of people around.  We had 4 cocktail waitresses poolside which was a lot and we all had to share one computer.  We were talking amongst ourselves after one rotation of collecting orders, and we all saw the same boner.  We were to busy to do anything about it, so we let it slide for a while and forgot about it.  Literally two hours later I walk by the same guy again, and I realize its not his boner, thats just how he is flaccid.  Then I realized that all the people around him were girls and there were like 10 of them.  It was insane.  I have never seen a bigger schlong.  It had to have been bigger than my wrist and at least 9/10 inches and this was flaccid.  He realized I was staring in disbelief and gave me a big smile.  
Not that I know of, sorry. =/
[It's worse than terminal.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alzheimer%27s)  It's a hell that no one should have to endure.  If they can't find a cure, I say Terry should have the right to keep his dignity and die on his terms. Apparently, he thinks so as well.
Only if by most people, you mean North and South America. There's a lot of people in tomorrow right now. In fact, most people.

I did not know that, thank you.
I've got that one!  But thanks!  It is hard for me to find ones I do not have.  
Then, yes, I want you to beg.

Yeah, I was trying to imply that I wasn't going for "obscure" movies as much as movies that I would recommend to someone who like Primer and THX 1138.
Even then.  We've only found about 1% of the species that have existed in the past 10,000 years, let alone the last 250 million.  We can count on our fingers the amount of our own species two million years ago that have been excavated.
The scientific consensus is shifting away from that view, FYI. Turns out fats in the diet aren't that bad for you.  Processed foods, on the other hand, are terrible, regardless of its fat content.
Ah, the transmission.  This is true.  If it were an STi it would be less of a concern, but the WRX is much weaker.
That's a good point, but they could still have language and culture.  Didn't some of the dinosaurs have fairly articulate claws?  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Velociraptor_mongoliensis_jmallon.jpg  Edit: if you look at that reconstruction a bit and really think about this, it's a bit Lovecraftian... :) 
Not because I say so, but because products that do that already exist, and sell very well.  You can't do anything on the iPad that you can't do on an iPhone, but it is miles away from an actual netbook.

That's the thing, it wasn't very far into it.  I felt a tinge of itch and thought I'd try the garlic thing since I'd heard about that...and after the garlic, wow, it got out of control.  I'm not blaming the garlic, necessarily, but it doesn't instill much confidence and given the pain that followed its use, I'm not eager to try it again!
Not as far as I know.  I know it's not a requisite for sleep apnea, but I'm not at all overweight.  I sleep on my side (which is going to fuck up my shoulders, but it's the only way I can sleep), and unless my sinuses are clogged, I've never been known as much of a snorer.
I used to gauge my ears so I was familiar with the scale.  I never realized how many old people had pierced genitals!

Hm. Well I had heard that if you pick one or the other, the one you did not pick will no longer be loyal. Oh well!  I guess it doesn't really matter, but I still want to stand my point that maxing out Paragon or Renegade early on is really helpful

The members of the dodgy areas are bleeding into the city at an alarming rate. A few months ago we were beaten up by a bunch of 20 teenagers from Frankston just for walking past them. This was at 11PM on a Friday outside the State Library in Melbourne. Unfortunately there's no telling where they will be. Unfortunately it's the luck of the draw sometimes.   I'm white btw.

I post facts, but you decide to personally attack me?  What the fuck is wrong with you?  Yes, women and children get killed in a war.  If you support the liberation of the oppressed indigenous people of the Palestine Mandate then follow international law and quit telling them how to run their insurgency.
Yeah, film yields great results. I still shoot a lot of medium format with a Yashica TLR.  Also, 4x5 still yields better image quality than any consumer digital camera out there.  Overall, though, digital is already the clear winner for many reasons.
hmmm. Yeah i have a touch. I didn't think about that. Hmm. Well if they would only open up their software....
I think we might have had someone who was a former behind the scenes person. I think we had a local Fox affiliate - but that doesn't count.
Well, if you need one sooner rather than later and would like to reduce your buyer's remorse, you could look at the refurbs available on Apple's website.  These items were returned because they had problems, repaired, and include the full warranty and are still eligible for Applecare.  The only disadvantage is that these items come in plain brown boxes rather than the original packaging:  http://store.apple.com/us/browse/home/specialdeals?mco=F462EFAC

Oh, there must be several of these because that's not what I saw.  I tried to look up the Tales from the Crypt one, and I'm a little confused now but still pretty sure it's what I'm thinking of (I saw this before I had closed caption, and I'm deaf, so the plot isn't quite what I thought it was).  Apparently the man's deformed hand was his evil conjoined twin brother or something, and they end up putting him in a meat grinder... awesome.
All I know was that at the top of the bottle under Bike Medicine it says biodegradable.  I guess it might be bunk but the optimist in me wants it to be true haha.

I'm using layman's terms. I'll be the first to admit that I don't have experience with the use of these terms and their literal definitions. I am trying to say that the mass corporate media in the U.S.A. is of poor quality because it is in the interest of said corporations. I apologize for sounding like an ass and using terms that I don't have working knowledge about.

Honesty isn't mean.  And tell her I gave her a vote, a down vote in hopes it will drive her to improve her artistry.
well the way he phrased it, "what was A vs. B", you would expect a ratio.  If he had phrased it "A over B", then maybe a quotient.  And "A out of B" would be a fraction.  Out of all of these, quotient is definitely the most unusual word, methinks.

I think they are poorly written in a sense that the majority of his music seems to be a bunch of unrelated one-liners and jokes strung together to make a decent length song. I am a fan of his older stuff like Da Block is a Hot and Carter 1. But I can't say that I enjoyed a single song on Tha Carter 3 (no ceilings was better from him).

You might have previously been afraid of burning in hell, but, in contrast to the Sun, it is not real. 
Because of the way our society handles the elderly, basically shipping them off and away from the site of younger people, most don't really get to see what alzheimers does to a person. We get happy little sitcoms where it seems like it's just a fun party where you're a little goofy and confused but otherwise it's great! The reality is that it's closer to a living hell. 
&gt;I think she purposely gave us inaccurate formulas to work with sometimes just to see who would catch on and notice that the results were ridiculous.  Those are some pretty ridiculous teaching methods.
Yeah, the clip I've seen so far is brilliant. Here's hoping the rest of the movie is as good, and that if it is, it gets a US theatrical release!
Match the lube to the environment. There really isn't such thing as one lube to rule them all. If it's gonna be a wet ride, then use a wet lube. If it's gonna be a dry ride, then use a dry lube. I don't mean to say clean your chain and relube with the appropriate lube for every single ride, simply match the lube to what environmental conditions you will typically encounter.  For normal/wet conditions I like [Tri-Flow](http://www.triflowlubricants.com/Tri-Flow_Superior_Drip_Lubricant.html) or [Finish Line Ceramic Wet Lube](http://www.finishlineusa.com/products/ceramic_wet_lube.htm). For dry conditions I like [Finish Line Dry Teflon Lube](http://www.finishlineusa.com/products/teflon-plus-lube.htm). FWIW, I loathe wax lubes. They don't seem to hold up very well in my experience and over time they with build up and harden on your chain and end up being really difficult to clean when needed.
Oh, sorry to hear that.

Anything by Smuttynose for sure. That brewery is fantastic. If you want to try something truly unique go for Dogfish Head.   What did you like about Arrogant Bastard?   Also, get your hands on Victory. Especially HopDevil, Prima Pils, and Storm King Stout.   If you see Sierra Nevada Bigfoot, definitely pick that up as an intro into extreme beers. I'm sure it'll be crazy your first few sips, but it's what got me into extreme beers. I've been into craft beer for 2 years and I get a new six pack every week. Check reviews at Beer Advocate, as well. Anything B or above is definitely worth checking out when you're getting into beer.

Well, doing that is healthier than drinking yourself to sleep every night. Cheers, mate.
Pretty much. More often it was subtle, like "I was in Mr. Stadtler's biology class," which is not how you would generally refer to a college class. At the time, almost anyone old enough to drink would have been out of high school when 9/11 happened.
Agreed. Thats why I chose the Apple on the back. It was between that and a swipe downwards on the bezel, and I thought that that would be more "ergonomically correct."

Nope, I already lost one job because a co-worker found out and complained to HR that I was harassing her(just that fact that she knew was enough for HR to fire me, It didn't matter that she found out off site and that I never made a pass or even talked to her or anyone else about about it. She found out, I didn't deny it, I got fired). I have kids to feed and bills to pay.

I agree, that people who talk but don't add to the conversation can be boring or frustrating. I suspect the threshold and criteria for this is subjective. How do you quantify someone who is talking but not adding to a conversation?

The article is talking about UBS operations in Switzerland, not just in America. It wouldn't matter if they didn't open branches in the US; the US government would still be trying to violate the sovereignty of Switzerland only to gain a few short-term political points.
How about a statistical analysis instead? Using color change as an indicator of significance is misleading, even if the correlation seems evident. This is on the same level as adjusting the scale of axes to amplify innocuous differences.

The OP seems to indicate that he was pulling the sleds in tandem.  But your explanation might still hold.  Intuitively, it would seem that the sled in the back might be drifting one way or the other and not perfectly in line with the puller and front sled.  I'm thinking of the sleds analogously to the double or triple trailers used by postal trucks (which are occasionally banned on steep/windy/slippery highways).

Well, the tax would have to be 14%, but I know what you mean, and that's a good point.  Combine tax with some rounding down ("$30" may really mean "$32.95" or something), and that could come out to over $80.

This doesn't make sense to me at all... (1) this doesn't match my experience, as holding shopping bag handles at say a 80° angle to vertical does not make them seem 5 times heavier (2) the horizontal force components in the ropes cancel out at the point at which they are tied together and (3) conservation of energy demands that the work done by your hands as you are raising the shopping bags from the ground equals the potential energy gained by the bags, which, since your hands and the bags are moving the same distance, requires that the forces be equal also.  Your argument and equation illustrates the case where there are pulleys directly in front of (but not attached to or touching) each bag / sled, keeping the ropes parallel to the direction of motion on the bag-side, and transferring the force at an angle to your hands.  In this case, the distance (and therefore force) traveled by your hands vs. the bags is indeed different.

now, for the other part of your post: holy shit are you ever confused.  you seem to be under the impression that a forest is a fixed size, and unless we cut some down it will not regenerate.  when you cut a tree down, the forest doesn't just magically replace that tree and stop growing.    trees sequester an amount of carbon proportional to their size.  cutting a tree down means that that particular tree can't sequester any more carbon.  the net effect of cutting a tree down is *not* that the volume of the tree is sequestered, that carbon is sequestered whether the tree is alive or sitting in your basement.  the net effect is that all the carbon that tree would have sequestered during the rest of it's lifetime is still in the atmosphere.

The current theory is his room was stormed by a group of up to seven men, a rag held to his mouth that may have been the delivery mechanism of the poison, and possibly electrocuted as well.
YAY ENGLISH!
I had an old friend who told me that eating that sandwich made him vomit for days. I for one like a little risk and when I eat out I accept that other people are making my food and I may experience some consequences. Regardless, I was too focused on his vomiting to ask-what makes a Moons over My Hammy?
Hum. You're right, a significant portion of the world's population is already hanging out on February 1st. - But, my guess is the (slim) majority of Redditors are Americans, so my point still stands.
I heard that was awesome actually, haha, wouldnt have thought people still play it....
Although I see what @gamblekat is saying, I don't think he's accurate. Given the amount of storage on an iPad, I'd say it's highly likely that a desktop or laptop is going to be necessary for anyone serious about organization, I don't think it'll be *required*, per se.   I believe what @gamblekat is hinting at is that if you want to, say, rip a CD or DVD and put it on your iPad, or copy your existing digital photos, you're gonna need a real computer, because if the iPad OS is anything similar to the iPhone, you will not have access to the file system. 
Ass to ass!

Haha I like this idea. "I would have picked it up sooner but I was undercover in France trying to protect the Faberge Egg of Prince Halalaj."

"Trainspotting" as in I pulled [a Spud](http://ifuctup.com/udonefuctup/spud-shit.jpg).  Thankfully, it wasn't an eighth that bad but still, it was the only way I could see to even consider laughing at the situation.
Sir?
If there is nothing else I have learned in more than 30 years upon this Earth it's this: "LISTEN TO THAT LITTLE VOICE IN YOUR HEAD".
Outside the last three hundred or so years, where we've actually scarred the land permanently, there would have been no way to tell that humans had existed here in 50 million years.  Mountains move, and are crushed, new seas appear, metal rusts.  Even any of our nuclear infrastructure would break down and be reclaimed.

There doesn't have to be any hate signs. Just stuff like "My boyfriend and I will bugger each other later after this picket. Come join us!"
It makes me sad too.  And they killed Deadwood after three seasons!  At least we'll always have The Wire and The Sopranos.  I deliberately ration myself on HBO series, only treating myself to a season every six months or a year.  I still have season five and six of the Sopranos to enjoy!  Hopefully HBO will pick up A Song of Fire and Ice.  That has huge potential.

They were doomed by evolutionary design. Like the mega fauna, they would have died at the end of the ice age, cro-magnom man or not.
Thanks. That seems like a sensible route to take. I have contacted my state reps and the local branch of the ACLU so I guess we'll see what happens. In the meantime, I think I'll explore becoming a notary. :)

The screen needs to support stylus input. Using my fingers is great and all, but there is a lot of potential for allowing a pen-like input. Note taking and drawing are just the most obvious. You could get away with it on the Iphone because its screen is almost too small for practical stylus use but that expansive Ipad screen is just begging for a pen.
I was hoping you would have the basic intelligence required to get my point, I should have known I was setting the bar a bit high for you. Anywho, it's been nice chatting.
This thread made me rofl!
Nope, you're good.  It hasn't been asked.  Most people had beach bags that they would put all their things in.  We also had an internal credit system members could utilize if they wanted to so they could go cash free, and just get a bill at the end of the month. Members also got 10% off of food.

The problem is there's so much confounding other stuff in the bible.    That's a nice message, and it's the message that JC gave at his biggest gathering (sermon on the mount), but you still have to be very selective to only come away from the Bible with that.

I agree with you about many of his songs just being one-liners strung together. He has such a tremendous volume of music and much of it admittedly isn't very good. A lot of his best stuff appears on mixtapes and albums by other artists. A current favorite of mine is [Demolition Freestyle Part 1](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJ2__SuftXo) from Gudda's recent Guddaville mixtape which features a simply ridiculous verse from Weezy.
i went to college with a lot of deaf kids.  one lived across the hall from me in our dorm and he was profoundly deaf (type of classification).  we had fire alarms with strobe lights and insanely loud noises, so loud that he could hear them.    this stuff would wake anyone up from their slumber, even helen keller.
His name was Robert Vist.
Holy. Shit. 
Actually in Canada, the Harper government was so scared of all the info coming out of Afghanistan (mainly the torture stuff) that they shut down Parliament.

It's better left untold. Funnier that way. Didn't mean to post the story as bate or anything. It's just fun to say it out loud. I also like the idea that sentiment can be conveyed with out blowing the potential to resurrect it. An IMA could blow that...   Edit: I will say that it made me feel great. It totally reorganized my concept of identity. Also, it proved to me my feeling that music curating is completely fucked up these days. Getting ready, then going out like that was heart pounding. Then being there and talking to like the stage manager and all, was nerve racking but exciting. I was always trying to forget the wig and not adjust it.  I had done another similar thing before too. I went to a small town revival church. Dressed as a local. Hung out and then got called up for a healing. It was great. I got to get smacked on the head and have convulsions!
I highly recommend Music Player Daemon to you. It is, as the name would suggest, a daemon for playing music. You can use whatever client(s) you would like with it. There are all kinds of clients, ranging from bulky to minimalistic, and GUI to CLI.  Here's a list of good clients in case you are interested. Sonata is my favorite. It is a highly minimalistic gtk interface, with some nice optional features such as lyrics. http://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Mpd#Client_install_procedure

As I've pointed out before.  What we're debating is the social contract. Implied consent is established once you become of age and partake of societies services and protections.  When you turn 18 you are free to jump into the ocean and leave. No aggressor will stand in your way.  You are born with absolutely no rights to property. You only have the right to your own body, and no aggressor is stopping you from removing yourself from the social contract.  
never accept the status quo!
Corporatist, then. Although that's just sliding further and further away from socialism.

OK, I said they quote Sitchin but what I should say is that they often quote the same thing and that Sitchin says it first... which suggests they have the same script perhaps. Or that they are indeed quoting the other. Annunaki, those from heaven to earth came etc. Maxwell is more of a [collaborator](http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x52q72_jordan-maxwell-private-interview-wi_news) &lt;- look slightly scripted anyone?.  I guess. I hear he did the rounds for 20 years etc but I've never seen anything to support that, other than his claims. In fact, he appeared towards the end of William Coopers reign from nowhere but as far as I know, nobody had heard of him apparently apart from his claim that he was doing the circuit? Shakes head. Not even William had heard of him when he entertained him on his show. Alarm bells anywhere? A Chime even? Give it a day or so and they will be constructed no doubt because it's been called out but what today? Throw me a bone! Jordan or Russel Pine perhaps?

&gt;It means you can shape your comments for gaining points.  I suppose I *couldI*, but I don't.  &gt;I'm allowed to say this as a blind assumption, if I'm granted the same freedom you had in assuming I only delete comments when I am disagreed with.  I didn't assume that you *only* delete comments when you're disagreed with.  I assumed that you deleted *this specific comment* because you were disagreed with.  I based that assumption on the fact that you *said* that's why you deleted your post: "I have deleted my post due to a downvote avalanche caused by your bitching."  &gt;It was technically the same thing someone else said.  I guess I'll have to take your word for it, since the comment is no longer there for me to see.  Oh, and I would have upvoted your comment, but I no longer have that opportunity.

&gt;Hamas as an organization purposefully target civilians and they are by no means angels either.  I don't believe Israeli colonists *are* civilians. They've violent occupiers and colonists. If I was a Palestinian I would very likely join one of the terrorist organisations and attack as many of the violent occupiers as possible. In fact Barak said the same thing not too long ago! If I was born an Israeli I'd try to get my ass out of there as fast as possible or even join the Palestinians in their fight for liberation!  &gt;Both of them have noble goals.   That's like claiming both Nazi Germany and the countries it attacked and occupied had noble goals. Its morally offensive, dear sir!  &gt;So you sir, snap out of it because you're supporting terrorists.  No, I am supporting freedom and liberty.

I've been bartending for 5+ years. At first, all I could do was notice how they do not tip. After a while I just accepted it. One time the bouncer and I were bored and ordered a pizza. I gave him my half of the money plus half of a normal tip. The pizza took way long. After they came I asked him if he shorted the guy a tip (some people do this, I still refuse to short them tips). He had no idea what I was talking about, because he *didn't know you're supposed to tip pizza delivery guys.*

There is a 'rule' of running known as the 10% rule: Don't increase the total mileage of your workout from week to week by more than 10%.  Even if you are a more experienced runner switching to a new shoe/gait, the rule should probably still stand.     Search 10 percent rule for a better explanation- apparently there is some science behind it.  Oooh! Science!

&gt;I said conservatives value work ethic, business sense, and sound financial decisions,  That's the problem. When conservatives usurp something good and declare it belonging to a group of people ("Family Values", "work ethic", "fiscal reposnsibility"), they are saying this way that non conservative cannot possibly have a work ethic (which is bullshit), that a non conservative cannot be fiscally responsible (yeah look at Clinton's proficit, and a financial disaster of Bush), that a non conservative cannot possibly  have good morals (hence the outrage over a simple and non threathening message "We are also good people" coming from atheists).   When they put themselves on a such pedestal it becomes impossible to laugh and ridicule human failure, because then conservatives have to recognize that everyone fails. And THAT goes against their worldview of bad and good (conservative) people.

The sad thing is that it even fails as a soap opera. The whole people who don't know each other locked up away from home inside a giant piece of technology sounds like it was tailored to me.

The plot device of strangers locked up like that, confused, and in danger while their personalties conflict with each other and factions form or dissolve? Love that!

I disagree when it comes to harder drugs, which is clearly what the OP was involved with.  In fact, selling someone Heroin is still putting them at risk. I smoke weed daily, and I know drugs are often not as bad as the government will have you think, but I have seen people both close friends and acquaintances absolutely destroyed by these drugs. They are not to be taken lightly.

The problem with Starbucks VIA is that it costs a hell of a lot more than any other instant coffee on the market. And instant coffee is one of the least cost effective ways to drink coffee already. The amount of coffee you get per dollar is abysmal versus brewing your own, only eclipsed by actual Starbucks coffee, which is crazy ripoff expensive.

I work at a local chain, much like Chili's... Black people tip, on average, 4 to 6%. Well, that's what I've calculated it to be. I tend to tip the hostess NOT to sit me black people. Racist, maybe, but I make significantly more now.
Ahhh, so true.  Thanks for pointing that out.
Went to the urban dictionary on this one.  I assumed based on the video I knew what it was, but I had never heard it before.
Oh what a coincidence, I bought speakers from them too!! Ha, their boss sure is dumb, ordering too many speakers and stuff! I paid only 200 bucks for like thousand dollar hi-fidelity speakers! We sure are lucky being the only 2 guys in the right place at the right time to score a sweet deal!
You sir, are above average.
Oh shit, sorry about that!  Since you are serious....  As to running away from things he deserves vs. doesn't deserve [from your post a few posts up], since our aptly named penile system is so sick, and he will probably get ass raped in prison for years or more likely decades, and will probably come out as some kind of tatoo'd psychopath, but now he seems to be Mr. Happy Productive Member of Society, don't you think this is a better outcome for all involved?  
I read that as orangutan. shudder. 
The perceived difficulty of pulling or carrying an object depends on the *tension* in the rope that is attached to the object. When the rope is at an angle with respect to the direction of motion, then only the component of the tension parallel to the motion contributes, meaning a higher tension is required to move the object forward.  This is also why power lines sag. Consider a completely horizontal power line. There would be no way for tension to act so as to oppose the force of gravity. This is why the power line must sag slightly so that the upward sloping parts at either end can exert tension to hold up the power line.
You should always stand firm against anti-erectionists.

I usually do the blow-and-test, too.  The rare time I get burnt is when I don't expect it to be hot or I'm VERY hungry and decide to roll the dice.

I will whine about downvotes I recieve as much as I please if I feel they are undeserved and violate the most basic of rediquette.  You are not required to upvote me after I do so either, so I see not why this would be an issue for you.

There used to be an invite bot but I think that died or something.  http://www.reddit.com/r/BaconBits/comments/at10l/baconbits_faq/  That's just a general FAQ but it also lists an IRC channel where you might be able to get an invite. 
Heh, I *knew* this was going to turn into a [MultiValue](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MultiValue) discussion at some point, as soon as I saw the way the data was laid out.
The fact that you're reaching some common ground with me is actually making my mood a lot better, and for that I thank you. Even if our whole conversation has been about "reactions based on the opinion of another", I do hope you don't have an *entirely* terrible image of me from this encounter. Even if you do, then I suppose I can't change that. Good luck, and happy redditing :)
I got that, but it was vague.
thats a brilliant idea
My research did not answer my actual question, so I asked and still have no answer for my question. I will wait for the report, if there ever is one made publicly. 
I think Monk is the most overrated show in the history of TV.       
&gt;I would try it myself, but my beta key was already in use.   That's a shame because it's fun as hell. 
Yeah, but while they're all crazy, only a select few are complete dickheads. There are a lot of nice people out there whose only fault is thinking they get some sky cake.
The fuck is that supposed to mean?  Being fair to gay people is a social experiment now?  Classic bigotry.  
The teacher was right. Bankers are sleazeballs. They need to be fed to the guillotine. But this banker and his snitching son have the power to punish a poor paid teacher for telling the truth about any of them.    No wonder the wealthy have such distorted beliefs, if they go to schools where the true nature of wealth is disguised. 
Honestly, the only way I could see it being done is as a faux documentary that adds another frame to the story, more or less a sequel that also recovers the original story, rather than a direct adaptation.  In a way, that would fit the spirit of the story.  A direct adaptation is just plain impossible.  
didnt upvote until i saw this :)
Fantastic story.  You're a great writer.  I read the whole thing.  Excellent!
Yeah! Right on! I am backing a loaf of bread right fucking now! Wheat forever, rice eat never! Wheat forever, rice eat never!
The natives are not forced to live anywhere, individuals can live wherever they wish.  I agree the "re-locations" were wrong, but how can we fix it now?  What if they knock up at your door saying, "were sorry Mr. fearfuljesuit but this house now belongs to the Delaware tribe again.  Pack up."   Lets also remember that a lot of tribes reveled in torturing (horrible tortures)early colonists and people on the frontier.  The native crying at the pollution is a bit of marketing.  And, I've known poor people who have gotten educations and have lifted themselves up from the lowest circumstances.  White and black.  My problem is the victim mentality displayed by many natives and blacks that really only hold them back in the end.    Just curious, what injustices do the natives face now? 
Taste is subjective.
Are you a girl who eats lazers, or a lazer that eats girls? 
No I don't, I would love to more often, but I never find time (this has nothing to do with me being busy or not, more so just lazy).  It's not difficult, you can be up one of our mountains in the thick of the wilderness in about a 45 minute drive. With that being said I'm sure there is something closer that could emulate the wilderness, that I'm not aware of.
Well I was still only 3 when my mom came back into my life, so I was young enough to not really grasp the significance of it at the time. With your 2 year old you should be okay, but your 4 year old will become aware that mommy and daddy aren't around in a few years. It's really a personal decision that you and your wife need to make, but if it was my children I would explain the situation to them as best as I could before it happened.
You got close enough to SMELL it? What does it taste like?
I hear ya.
&gt; We also had an internal credit system members could utilize   How did they activate their credit?  Was it thumbprint based, or did you need a card of some sort?
Once more, I'm not looking into doing this myself. All that I'm asking is whether or not its legal. I understand your concern, but it's unfounded with this. But I guess since only minors are allowed in school, I'm asking about them in particular. And yeah, I'm a minor.
Haha, well I've been going down on her for a long time (not just because I wanted something in return, I'm geniunely interested in her happiness and comfort). But I'm not really interested in lying to her — I'd rather be up-front and sincere about it.
Had that happen recently in a movie theater.  Black couple with kids comes over and wants me and my nephew to move from the primo seats we got because we were there early.  Their reasoning was we should  move because they want to sit together.    I flat out refused, and they immediately turned it into I'm a racist, its because they're black.  I just said no its because you're a bunch of jerks that got here late.
I'm sure she's used to the environment already.
Um, it has nothing to do with network programming, it's just a pun. If you haven't heard the song, I don't think you will get it.
Hey tinglything, I don't know if you're aware of this or not, but pretty much everything you do in school has been done before.  Someone else doing it first doesn't mean that a sammich maker build would not be educational.    Sometimes hipsters annoy me.
Are we sure about that?   Also, the Inca Empire spanned most of South America, and they never invented the wheel.

I dont watch porn, but I heard a lot of the residents had their own websites, and there were a few producers there too. To answer your question, no one I recognized from their fame, but I did see a few people who I knew from interactions in the neighborhood/at a different job that I worked so it was entertaining.  
I meant 2D in the gameplay sense, not the visual one.  There's some debate whether or not they will use hand-drawn sprites (a la WarioLand: Shake It!) or models (a la New Super Mario Bros.).  We'll find out soon enough, I'm sure.
You could always approach it the way my boyfriend does.  We'll be watching TV and out of no where he says "Hey, do you want to play with my penis?"

It would be insincere. 
No, I had the car for 3-1/2 years at the time, paid $17,500 for it. At the time of the accident, the car booked for $9,800, but I only owed $3,000 on it. Since the insurance company totalled the car, they cut me a check for fair market value for a comparable replacement ($9,800), so after paying off what I still owed on the car loan ($3,000), I pocketed $6,800.  Edit: I know, I know, I didn't exactly get a good deal on a specific item I was buying, but hey, $6800 in my pocket is one hell of a bargain to me, especially after I figured the car was only worth about $5,000 and I would have made out $2,000 on the whole thing. The extra $4,800 that I wasn't planning on was a nice surprise. :)
Yes.  The first thing you do burn a copy of your favorite Linux distro.  The second thing you do is reformat your hard drive.

100 times yes...  plus I agree with Oz, Twin Peaks, The Wire, Curb Your Enthusiasm, Carnivale, Deadwood, Sopranos, Breaking Bad, Six Feet Under, and if you're really hard up, Weeds...
I think every (sane) ordinary employee seeks these, yes. There will always be a few outliers, but generalising bad behaviour (i.e. the greedy stockbroker) to an entire occupation isn't fair.  And yes, I think at least the first 6 would apply to a barber. I know a hairdresser who's taken over the shop from his boss after thriving in those conditions. You don't have to be white collar to want those things.

I wouldn't worry about conspiracy theorists working from a script or being collaborators or quoting each other. It's a waste of time and energy. I read everything and take it all with a massive grain of kosher salt.   (Except Sitchin - I have never read his works because they seem geared towards the fanstastic in order to sell his books to spaced out new agers).  &gt;Annunaki, those from heaven to earth came etc.   Erich von Däniken was postulating the same theories in 1968. Everyone borrows and builds upon everyone else.  Even William Cooper veered into space-alien territory towards the end. That's where I stop listening. But one thing Bill said sticks with me:  "Listen to everyone, read everything, believe nothing unless you can prove it in your own research."

I owned a restaurant for 23 years, and raised prices many times. Demand never went down on a price increase. If you raise the price of a bag of potato chips by 5%, you think someone who would have purchased that bag of chips is going to instead be motivated to  purchase a bundle of fresh spinach? 
It is irrelevant though.  I seriously doubt any of the people still playing 1.6 will embrace this mod more than they did CSS.   It's essentially got the same challenges that Valve had, trying to mimic an old engine with a new one.  And Valve had the benefit of original source code an genius developers.

Yeah, I've seen that lecture too ... http://academicearth.org/lectures/death-intro  Regardless, the only point that I would advocate my own death, is if I am brain-dead and can no longer experience anything anyway.  Edit : On another note, I'm not afraid of death. Just like I'm not afraid of the time before I was born.
Ooh I get it. It sounds like "sock it to me."  I must be slow today O_o (although I haven't heard the song)

Prisons have gone through a LOT of reform in the past 20 years or so. Modern prisons and laws protecting inmates are really inventions of the last decade and a half, and many of them were created in response to situations like my mother's.
Yeah, no joke.  I was voting him up, despite the downvotes he had already accumulated.  I just felt like it was kind of shitty that he was getting so much hate.  But then I got to this one.  I mean, damn.  I'm not gonna go back up and change votes, but I can't figure out why he's so pissy.
Nope.  I've never even met my past couple sets of neighbors.  I just know they're some old ladies.

I was 16 and I had been on a Zombie kick for a while and had burned through all the really scary ones and had been finding that most of the remaining selection had been getting more goofball. I thought it was time to switch it up. I went up to Blockbuster and picked out EH and Texas Chainsaw Massacre (original). Went back and watched them both back to back alone in my dark room. Bad Idea. I love those 2 to this day.

The Shining - agreed.  I remember seeing a *preview* for the Shining a few months before its release.  The preview, as I recall, was silent and set in the hotel lobby framed on the elevator doors.  The doors open slowly and a torrent of blood comes pouring out in slow-mo and eventually fills the room so that all the viewer sees is a screen of red.  That fucked with my little mind for many nights.
Agreed.  The past century's quite understandably weaned us off the teat of colonialism, mind. There's such a cultural stigma attached to Empire that it's unthinkable to play the aggressor in a territorial war.
If there are more black people who are poor and want to go to college than there are white people who are poor and want to go to college, then more black people would get scholarships if scholarships were based purely on income.  I think that scholarships should be based on a combination of income and merit (with income as the more important factor), and that's it.
I've only met a few French people here, but I'm in college so I may not be the best demographic to ask that question.  Montreal is only an hour and a half away though.
I like food and all, but that sounds like a terrible class. 
I agree, much more elaboration here on this topic
I think psychology is also a factor. There are friends that I think have more friends than I do, but I've never actually asked them. In their absence, I know what I am doing (most likely on the computer) but I have no idea what they're doing. So I assume the best -- that they're out with friends having fun; moreover, they assume the same with me which is definitely not the case.

That's what I'm thinking, which was why I asked if subby was her husband's first. However, when I was too nervous to get it up for my first girlfriend, I found other ways to please her and kept trying. Maybe he's stressed out at work and thus too tired. Maybe he's realized that he's gay. Maybe she's gotten fat.

30 seconds? nice. Usually, if I have half an hour to spare, I'll lie down, and will fall asleep after 10 minutes, leaving another 10 minutes to wake up and go "cool, I have more time to sleep". After the second 10 minutes, I'm feeling very refreshed. I also have lots of dreams during these

&gt;Regulations help the powerful minority exploit the majority  That's quite the generalization. Its this sort of dismissal that so frustrates those who disagree with you. You quite simply insist that any acceptance of the idea of a 'good' regulation or tax is an acceptance of tyrannical imposition.   You've descended into anarchist apologia.

Not so at all. What matters is the projection of the pulling force on the direction of the motion. It is exactly the same no matter whether the sleds are side-by-side or in line!

Ok. I cannot see a problem of taking pictures in a school, as a minor, of other minors as long as it is not in locker rooms, bathrooms or anything lewd. But, students really do not have constitutional rights as adults do (thank the supreme court) and are subject to rules from the school admin. In loco parentis or something. Im not a lawyer so don't trust a word I said.
While true, talking about it isn't going to break the relationship (considering how long they've been dating). It may be awkward to address the issue head on, but a lot of things are, and that's no reason not to talk about it.

Hi son.
This made me pretty happy to be from Vermont.
I moved away after college to place where I didn't know anyone, so I know full well that saying to just go out and meet people is easier said than done. At the same time, I hope you realize that making friends takes a lot more than just a casual conversation in the elevator. If you're just having small chit-chat then it's not surprising that people don't seem interested in you. It's not just you; that happens to everyone. Have you tried meeting people with similar interests? You mentioned that you got a pilot license in another response. I think that makes great material for a conversation. I bet if you find someone who's currently in the process of getting his own license or would like to get one, he would enjoy talking with you.
D'you get wafers with it? 
No, all that it means is that the gas is not automatically cut out when the brake is pressed. Any smart driver knows to put the car in neutral, which is an action not prevented by this suggested issue. If you just stab the brakes and give up and keep screaming you're going to crash. Any good-functioning brake system can overpower the engine and stop the car. Car and Driver proved this recently, even with a 500+ hp Mustang.

&gt; If you ate 42 cupcakes a week, people would call you a fattie. Yet 42 beers a week is fine? Its not 6 beers in one sitting that is the problem, is 6 beers a night, EVERY NIGHT.  Read the argument.  The parent above me is making the argument that any type of "abusive" behavior steams from "some sort of problem he doesn't want to deal with,".  That is likely not true and secondly, it's a bad logical argument to get with and third, it's not going to "help" or be productive.  You have to find out WHY he is drinking.  Don't assume he has some deep emotional turmoil he is suppressing.   There is LOTS of reasons a person might eat or drink to excess.  One being, that it's enjoyable.    Secondly, your uncle is anecdotal evidence, but yes - excessive drinking over a long period of time has been shown to cause negative side effects on a persons health.

UBS is at fault for facilitating their American client to commit crime. UBS is still free to operate in Switzerland but if they keep up their behaviour, they should get kicked out from using dollar which is American currency.

Sweet! Thanks very much. I already have a question, though: Should I go ahead and install Windows and then try and boot Android, or can I just go straight to it? I'm looking at the ''Diamond builds'' page and there is a list of ''bundles'' and ''experimentals'' and ''other files''. I'm pretty sure I dont need anything experimental, but are the other two ALL I need?
You should just ask. I'm sure she'd understand that you're interested in a blowjob and I doubt she'd take offense or get angry for any reason. Besides, in this day and age, blowjobs are fairly commonplace and nothing to be embarrassed about in any way.  Of course, picking the right time to ask is important. Asking during dinner with your parents of course, is an obviously bad choice, but asking after a shower is a pretty good time. That way it's clean, you're naked, everything's ready to go.  Good luck
I think you can make a safe bet that it was the mossad. This is how they roll, and they wanted his ass dead for about 20 years. What's more intriguing is why he had no bodyguards with him at the time.. that makes no sense.
Dude wtf?  By the time the Chinese invaded, the US had already done bombing runs into Chinese territory.  China did not invade North Korea.  China liberated it.  The US didn't invade France in WWII.
Oddly, the tourguide told me 40million just for 20 miles of paved road.  And they're putting in an airstrip.
So is having exactly the kind of sex you want to have.

That's kind of what I thought but I couldn't figure out the bargain aspect of it.  What was the car actually worth?  Edit:  Ah, makes sense now.
Why did you move to Argentina?
Yeah, I just realized that after taking a closer look at the imdb.  My French club at my uni watched it and I always assumed that it was French and not Quebecois.

Me too, actually. The colour reminded me of dog turds after they've been sitting on the ground for several weeks.
My only problem is I'm at work and now crave one.
Certainly he did. Jesus' metaphor for hell was 'Gehenna', the garbage dump outside Jerusalem, full of garbage, corpses of executed criminals and smoldering fires, where OT kings once sacrificed children. If that is the metaphor, the real place (or state of existence, if you prefer) must be quite terrible.
I want someone to share experiences with, sure.  It seems a lot more practical to have friends.  You can share the rent and food bill, cover for each other's slacking, drive while the other sleeps, etc.  I know this species only came this far because of collaboration.

It's funny, I started this post to sort of warn people off since I thought it was a waste.  Look at all the shit that got stirred up!  WEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!!!!!
And where would they keep their card?
I do understand that, however If you read my post you would realize I'm trying to make the point that the large amount of regulation is justified at this point in time due to a very high safety risk, and deregulation doesn't make sense due to those safety/political concerns. It is silly to think that these regulations are causing an impending monopoly when we can plainly see the industry moving in the opposite direction, and even more ridiculous to assert it is currently illegal to start a company in this field. There is regulation in every form of transportation, so take a look around at it; regulation in space travel(even at a higher level) does NOT necessitate a monopoly. Sure the cost of entry rises but we're talking about spacecraft here, not pencils.
That would be The Witches by Roald Dahl. Its actually a pretty great  book.
What obligations? What reality are you living in?  Your being born into a land where all the physical land is already owned. All its owners have agreed to a set of rules.  You're the outsider here.  You're the aggressor demanding special privileges from an already established community.  You walked in from your mothers birth canal and then tell us we can't ask you to leave if you won't accept our standards? What the hell happened to our property rights?  I'm telling you you are free to leave, no-one is making you stay. 
Is that you Jim?  http://video.yahoo.com/watch/4653268/12437422
Yes.  It was interesting for me to find out that there were many priests that broke away from the bureaucracy to support the victims, but these were unofficially "cut loose" by the bureaucracy and left at the mercy of the military.  It probably is worthwhile drawing a distinction between the Church bureaucracy and individual priests, many of whom paid for their selflessness with their lives.
Sorry, I don't understand why you bring that up when we are discussing the shackling of women during childbirth, which has been ruled unconstitutional by the 8th Circuit Court of Appeals because it constitutes cruel and unusual punishment.
I had an "oh come-the-fuck-on" moment when that was reveled as their weakness. So dumb. that and "Swing away" I hate M. Knight.
I actually haven't been able to confirm that it does or doesn't, but everything that's out there on the device points to an upscaled Ipod so I don't really expect it to. The Ipod screen uses projected capacitance so you have to use your bare fingers. Even a light pair of gloves is enough to prevent your touch from being detected. There are ways around the limitations of PCT but unless the Ipad is intended to be used with a stylus, none of the apps will be designed to take advantage of this form of input.
Its not uncommon in some of the rural areas to have private Fire/EMS services licensed by the county.  I've worked for public and private EMS and the level of service is much better for public in my opinion. One of the most depressing things I saw was when someone realized they were going to get a bill after their house burned down. Three hours on scene at a rate of $1200/hr; no homeowners insurance either.

I can understand that.  Probiotics are good.  :)  
i manage a group home for developmentally disabled adults.  one of the individuals has alzheimer's as well as some other neurological disorders.  it is really tough on his family.  i never knew him when he was able to remember people's names or perform his daily hygiene activities, but i have seen how much it affects the family and how much they miss their family member.  :-(

True enough. Getting her to actually talk about it sounds like it will be difficult, but they do need to discuss it, so he knows how she feels about it.
Really? Try pancreatic cancer. Also, go you Mr. tough-guy. You get to decide that you'll bear any pain just to exist. Let others make their own decisions. We all die, no matter how hard we cling to life. Some of us don't want our final years to be horrible pain mixed with losing our own identifies. Existing is dependent on identify, not just heart beat.  Edit: Somehow I missed this: "Everyone has a right to live their life if they please, even if that involves ending it." I still think you sound pretty judgmental about others choices, but I'm more supportive of what you said.

Not really. There's probably going to be just as many serious answers mixed in with off-color jokes as there are in any reddit comment section of a post asking for advice. Aside from the notorious /b/, the rest of 4chan is no different from Reddit aside from its interface.

No, I was a Massage Therapist in their spa.  We did not have the option of going topless there as that is against our license.  Most of my clients were un-draped.  
I believe Parmenides would have had serious issues with that movie.

Agreed.  But, can we both agree that the primary important bits -- those responsible for most of the device's performance and behaviour -- is going to be contained therein?  (GPU/CPU).  We know the CPU/GPU are licensed, what about the rest then?
Maybe morally, to you, but not practically.
Really? Like what?  Because last time I heard, it ran the same OS and had access to the same programs.  It doesn't even have the same hardware, like a phone or a camera.  In Apple's past successes, they were introducing a well-made product into an established market, the iPad is a product for a market that does not exist yet.
But that still was funny.  I would like to hear why you think he is a douchebag?

Yeah, I meant George Mason. They have a lot of specialists in Austrian Econ, I have no idea if their program is less mathematical.  Also, you seem to be implying that you're in an Econ MA program. May I ask where? I had always heard that they're only useful for people who didn't major in Econ in college, that you should really either be content with a BA or go for the PhD... what's your view on this? Not trying to be a dick, but I had to ask...

Wow I have the exact same story. I was leaving the grocery store and the two guys offered me the same deal. They actually let me name the price. I spent $300, mine are probably slightly better than yours. Oh well at least we have top of the line speakers for really cheap. They need to fire that boss or those poor fellows are going to keep losing money.
My name is Matt and I'm currently studying how to build our nation a better economy.  However, this only applies if you live in the USA. To the other 99.5% of the world, well... good luck catching whatever economic dandruff you can get when we get moving again.
Yeah, my bad, I was a bit vague at the get-go. 
Once I was on the roof of a three story building and Frisbeed my hat(an old irish cap) off as hard as I could. It was all off balance and floppy because its so worn. I was just going to fetch it from the yard later but after going thirty feet out it came right back to me, didn't even have to stretch out my arm to catch it.

Similarly I'd gotten a cardigan at a Goodwill in town for 4 dollars. When I checked the brand, thinking it looked familiar, I found that I had one just like it in my closet in a different color.   I'd bought the one I had at Macy's for something around 25 dollars. Half off of something around 50.  
It was their recap of the finale of Dollhouse that started this. I can't remember the last time I saw the words cute or neat used so many times to describe an apocalyptic future.

If I'm the one who always makes the first remark after a period of silence, then they're not contributing. A conversation isn't always going to be constant gab. There will be silence, but the same person shouldn't be guiding the topic of conversation every time.

Open it in preview and crop it. You could resize the image if you want, but the regular background settings will do that for you.
Well, it's either that or making it bulky with features some people don't want. I'm perfectly fine with the idea of barebones/almost no features approach. I got mine working exactly the way I like with 2 or 3 plugin and skin downloads, and then I just emailed it to myself so if I ever need a copy of it again I have it.
No, some very literally got addicted to Heroin, gradually spent their life's savings on it, alienated nearly all their friends because of it, and one eventually overdosed.  You tell me why a substance that can compel somebody to do that should be legal.  The right to ingest anything you desire does not include something that no man in their right mind would participate in if they were fully aware of what was in store for them. Most got into it because they were naive, and, like everyone else, thought they were perfectly in control and that they would never become a slave to drugs. How wrong they were.
Are you against shooting flaming arrows at things? 
It's clear to me now just what kind of nerd you are.
Troll kidney stones might be pretty rough..
I have a thing about chains/lube.  I remove my chain every sunday on my fixed gear and clean it and while the chain is off I clean the chain-ring and sprocket.  I don't think it'll be too much of a hassle to remove the chain and clean the gears etc on a Sunday on the Mountain Bike.  The way I see it; on Sunday (my therapy day) I will remove the wheels and chain, clean and tighten (check tension on) everything, lube all moving parts and pay attention to the chain and chain-rings and sprockets.  Seems like it's a recipe for longevity. I pretty much strip the Fixie every Sunday anyway.  I realize they are different bikes, but same amount of effort.
That's utter nonsense.  I use pidgin (2.6.4 currently) *all day* at work.  It is quirky, unstable and without any compelling features.  It's like ICQ from 1996 FFS.  I appreciate that some people have a holy-war to avoid MS software, but I dont.  I dont run 3rd rate software (pidgin) and pretend it's good.
Thanks for understanding = )
I wouldn't want her to be the same as she was before she went in. She cut herself every day, starved herself and attempted suicide on a regular basis. She doesn't do any of that any more, so her not being the same is a good thing.

I think I'll take this advice. I'll find an appropriate time to ask her and see if I can avoid making it awkward, but in the end holding discussion is more important than whether or not it's "awkward."  Thanks, guys.

I think the order is important.  It shows a fundamental difference in the writing process.  In legitimate journalism, the headline doesn't mean shit besides attracting people to read the article.  The content/writing of the article is important.  With the Onion, it's almost the other way around.

The end of story is this, if you give anyone the opportunity to do a brute hack, then you are doomed.

Yeah, the stories I've heard from people like my mom that care for the elderly...its rough thinking about it.
Oooh nooo, Macs cant get viruses... except for when you use software (Firefox) that has more security updates than Internet Explorer. Macs can get hit too, except the damage is usually less to the OS itself. Firefox itself could be infected though or a plugin is playing up.  FYI, before the haters complain, I use a Macbook, an iPhone and I also use Firefox.
Dante's Peak
Anything you've been using for years is going to be "easier to use" than anything you switch to.  It's exactly why windows users think that mac is harder to use, and why mac users thing windows is harder to use.  There's an actual term for this, but I can't remember it.

I'm sure a cat could survive the fall. And I didn't think it was serious either, but people get cyber lynched on Reddit for animal abuse, and sometimes, when it is unfounded. Someone, I'm sure could provide a link?
Oh god, this is the single funniest thing I've seen on reddit all day. 
What's the cup of coffee go to?   Very nice icons - are they images or a custom font? Did you make them or get them elsewhere?  And since this thread is supposed to be about insulting desktops I guess I have to insult your 1024x768 resolution (though I'm guessing you use a net-book).
&gt;It's like taking a free sample in the grocery store but throwing it in the trash instead of eating it.  No, it's not. In that case the item was meant to be consumed by an individual, not used temporarily and then passed along to the next occupant.  If the Gideons were handing out bibles to individuals in the street then I'd see no problem with taking one and using it as a doorstop or whatever. But that's not the situation.  &gt;I don't consider it stealing because it's something they're happy to give away for free  I'm happy to give away food for free, but if one of my friends walked into my house and took a sandwich from my fridge I'd still be peeved. Context changes everything.  Does this *really* not prick your conscience on some level?  [edit] Full disclosure: I have a problem with desecrating books in general, so your book burning doesn't sit right with me either.

Hmm...I'm not sure what you mean by the tracks being out of sync; the backing itself was just based on a crappy midi file, probably intended for use in ringtones, which seemed to have the timings right [hence why it was nearly identical to the original].  Do you think there could have been a delay inherent to the samples I used?  As for the voice timings, I was trying to copy Shatner's style, who generally doesn't seem to deviate very far from the backing "melody".

I get the volume number, but for every person that is wrongly convicted and goes through the motions of all the fighting from a to z, there are probably 10x (a random guess, but you get the point) as many that are not able to fight because they don't have the means. Plain and simple.
Most 7.62x54r ammo is corrosive and requires that you clean your rifle after firing. My understanding is that a dark barrel means the gun was not taken care of/cleaned correctly. Just a sign of the gun not being in good shape.

Compared to the rest of Canada we definitely have the most mild winters. This year has been particularly concerning on how mild it's been seeings we're hosting the winter Olympics and some of our mountains have had to close down due to lack of snow.  Even the worst winters we have are nothing compared to what you'd find in say Alberta or Montreal (I mention these 2 places as they are the most I'm familiar with in Canada other than Vancouver )

&gt;I don't think people will like that position if a more advanced and more intelligent extraterrestrial species came here and decided to eat us.

That's a very good point, but it's not what I am getting at.  I never said once that I don't think people should be able to do this, if that is their wish.  I don't like to dodge issues though, so here's my best answer. A pet cannot communicate its wishes. The best we can do is infer that it is beyond the point of enjoying life at all. That's all we can really do.  And ... again, I'm speaking from my personal perspective. If anyone wants to end their life, fine, that's not my place to say they can't.

The pulling force is along the direction of the rope. Therefore the projection onto the direction of motion will be T/cos(theta), which is more than the tension in the perfectly straight case.  You can't think of them as one big sled, what matters is the *angle* of the rope, which results in a higher force being exerted to overcome friction.

It never scared me, but I loved that movie.  My friends and I watched movies like that and Red Dawn hoping for the war to start so we could march off and form the Wolverines and finally put all those booby-trap-making skills we practiced in the woods to use!

Hmm... name calling?  Very mature... especially considering you really don't grasp economics.
In order the games go, UFO Defense, Terror From the Deep, Apocalypse, Interceptor. Enforcer was a stand alone title that doesn't have anything to do with the other games. 
fair enough, as long as we agree on the awesomeness of flaming arrows.
You can blame that trend on Reagan-era deficit spending.  The present reform is meant to reduce the deficit, government and private spending.  We can see many ways it can work around the world, and if we're really the best nation in the world, there should be no good reason why we can't make it work for ourselves.
I hope the coverage on this subject will be like daylight to cockroaches. 
Upvoted.
Taiwan never needs to have been part of communist China.  The same borders in place when the Kuomintang were in power remain in regards to international law.  Just because a regime collapses or is replaced doesn't mean the borders are now malleable.
Wait, what are my taxes for if you have to pay the fire dept to put out a fire?
If you have lead an evil life, terrible indeed. Frankly, the very idea of eternity frightens me.   What if it's even just eternal boredom? I might start hysterically begging for Ye Olde Lake O' Fire, myself.

true, but Anaheim still got fleeced.  i don't understand why they took Blake and his $4mil/year back instead of just giving Toronto a 1st rounder with Giguere for Toskala straight-up.

Exceptional insight from someone who doesn't know me in the slightest. I'm guessing that the irony of calling someone else delusional in that scenario is lost on you.

But why a knife? If it's close quarter combat between another mech, blunt force damage would probably be more effective, I don't see how stabbing metal works. If it's combat against a human, just swat at him with your arm and send him flying.

This scene stands out from my childhood as one of the most disturbing moments, both in the fictional land, and reality.  I forgot what movie it was from until I saw it again in my teens and it was just as disturbing seeing it again then.

&gt;God forbid you do any of your own research before continuing to debate the topic.  I love this and can think of a hundred different scenarios I encounter everyday where this statement could be applicable. Mind if I use it from now on? 
God I loved that movie.  For some reason, on like 3 snow days in one year, whatever teacher was in charge of babysitting us hapless souls who walked to school and actually showed up rented us The Neverending Story to watch in the gym. I was happy to watch it every single time.

I suppose I should clarify.  Burden of proof is on the one making the *absurd* claim. If I claim there is a sky, I don't need to prove it to anyone other than the most hardcore devil's advocates- I can just kind of wave my hands in an upward direction and say, there it is. If I claim there isn't one, well, then people ought to be asking me some serious questions.

I am not saying that there are not exceptions, just that if a company is looking for easiest way to make a decision, this is a pretty solid method.  While a few potential good clients my slip through the cracks, overall they will have fairly financially stable clients. In my particular example they are not worried about many of the other things an employer may be concerned about, just that they will pay their rent on time.

We snuck into a park at night to smoke weed and have sex under the stars.  After smoking up I had a sudden urge to climb a tree, so I started and he thought it was hilarious so he followed me up.  Then I got to this super thick branch and sat there, then he got to me and we started making out and one thing led to another.  In retrospect, I'm really glad we didn't fall, that would have been difficult to explain in the ER.
I wish I knew.  People do the ear canal irrigation thing, but that seems not so effective, not to mention kind of gross.  But I've never tried it, so maybe it really works.

I went through 12 years of hardcore depression by growing up in Kansas as a gay kid. I contemplated suicide many times.  I was a stupid fuck to think it was the right way out.   If I had the choice to either die, or go through it again, I would gladly do it again.  Edit : Awaiting response of "ohhhh it wasn't bad enough"

I don't know what you think Birthright is, but, uh, no.  Most Birthright trips are secular, and in practice it mostly seems to be an excuse for Americans to hook up with Israeli soldiers, which, when I went, was even explicitly suggested by the person organizing our group of buses.

i can't really explain why i think he's a douche.  it's just this irritated feeling i get when i hear him talk, like i can't wait for him to shut the fuck up.  like he's trying to be so hip and "internet", when in actuality he seems like some fratboy trying to exploit the nuances/"memes"/fads of a culture for his "comedy" fodder.  i also thought the bit about pot was really, really lame.  i don't have a rational, well-thought argument for you.

I don't think Socrates is uninteresting; it is just that your response makes me think of the pre-Socratics and how much fun they must have been.

Just saying...

This isn't an argument to *not* spay or neuter pets, but I'm pretty sure the reason we do it is so we don't have to deal with their offspring.  You can look at it as "compassion[ate]" with respect to the fact stray kittens and puppies aren't being dumped on the side of the road in cardboard boxes every other minute, but you're still neglecting the fact that half the reason we do it is so we avoid having to deal with a big problem *that would otherwise occur quite naturally*. Personally, I think that qualifies as a human gain.
I did. I thought that, considering that they were attempting to make a movie that had been considered un-makeable, they did an excellent job. I had some issues with things being cut out, but they reportedly fixed every issue I had with the film in the Director's Cut edition. Except for the ending, but I kind of liked the ending the way it was in the film. It made a bit more sense, at least.
Same here. I had to quit because I was letting it get in the way of my real life responsibilities.

The E-Ink thing is very different than a mobile phone or lcd computer display.  It doesn't have a back light and basically puts black text on a paper colored background.  You need a light source to read it just like you need a light source to read a piece of paper.  Sunny day outside?  No problem, assuming you can read a newspaper you can read an e-ink display.  iPad display is nothing like the kindle (and sony ebook reader) displays.

I want to start playing WoW, how long would it take me to get from 1-80?
Normally yes, but I can see snow and ice making things a bit more complicated. If you have two kids on one sled, you're concentrating more weight on a smaller surface area. This is going to create more heat under the rails, and melt more snow into water. The water would then act as a lubricant decreasing the friction.

It's definitely cheaper and faster than trying to teach the majority of them basic economics.   And isn't that what economics is all about? Efficiently allocating scarce resources to where there is demand?
I've read a couple of history books that said there is something to that.  Actually it is a little broader than just Arianism.  Middle-Easterners were alway uncomfortable with anything that seemed to detract from God's unity, like both the doctrines of the Trinity and the Incarnation.  So there were a lot of heretical sects in the Middle East and Egypt that found ways to deny one or the other.  Arianism was just one of them.  So when Islam came along they were very quick to embrace it.  There were political reasons, too, because they were also getting rid of a thousand years of Greco-Roman rule.

A great example to me is this: I never found Tom Cruise a phenomenal actor.

But since his outburts on Ophra, his scientology crap, etc.. I can't help it.  He's just a fucking douchebag to me.  I can't look at him in any other light what-so-ever.  I can't stand to watch a single movie with him in it no matter how bad or how good he's performing, b/c i stop seeing the character and all i see is Lord Xenu bullshit and funny little [gifs/vids](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4jo6KkFfIc) in the back of my head.

One is deliberate indifference, which would be a violation under the 14th amendment (your example of guards ignoring rape).  The other is an action by the prison official (the childbirth example). If a guard rapes prisoners as a part of a policy, that would certainly be an 8th amendment violation.

it's no big secret that nobody at Valve is deeply involved in the Counter strike brand, Source was coded in a matter of weeks and when it was first released had a lot of bugs. The updates were far and few between even when it first came out, and they've stopped supporting the game entirely now. This mod is essentially what the franchise needed, a reboot. If anything it will revive interest in the brand and it will prompt Valve to get to work on another sequel (which the community will undoubtedly hate but a large proportion of it will play anyway because it's popular)

In Mexico, my friends and I have a phrase we use when we accidentally sit on something. We say something along the lines of, "¡Que tarjetazo me acabo de dar!" It translates roughly to, "I just got credit-card-swiped real hard!"  It usually comes up when someone has to sit in the middle seat of a car and they sit down without first locating the middle seatbelt latch.
how much did you donate?
um, I don't think so.
I don't know is on third.
especially the Oscars, but that's yet another story.
&gt;Who do you think is paying that for their 12 year old??  My brother x2 kids
Yes. With 200 people.
That freaked me out as well.  Anything purported to be based on a true story strikes a fear chord with me.
I didn't mean for the title to imply that.  &gt; Reddit Design - Where do you get royalty free **AND** (cost $0) music and/or loops for your projects?  FIFY
"Bad people doing bad things" in this case means selling things people want to people who want them. This may be illegal but many (most?) people would not consider it wrong. Certainly not as wrong as killing, which the US does many times every day. So, whatever, I'm glad this guy got away.
Why does alcohol's potential to ruin lives mean that Heroin should be legal? You never even asked me if I drank, nor if I believed that alcohol ought to be legal.
Why can't I live within walking distance of an arcade?
Thanks, I was pretty sleepy this morning.
water proof capsules that they would put in their butts.  Sorry, not funny.  They would keep them in their wallet which would be in their beach bag.
Handwaving. Can you prove the title of the submission or not?
That's called denial that your society is so warped that even musicians (albeit this one is with conscience) even cancel tours after the BDS movement made him a target.  Now if he were to say that he was canceling be of Israel's illegal occupation he and his company would be open up to the crazed anti-Israeli boycott law in the US.  Read his fan page on facebook for a while and try to count the posts in the last two weeks imploring him not to place the xenophobic land of the chosen.
Absolutely! I'll look into effects like that. I made the model in Rhino, though. Does Sketchup have that 'pencil sketch' feature specifically?
This was the scene I had nightmares about.
you're an asshole but i laughed really hard at this
It's funny how, every time a sub comes on Reddit and explains how their lifestyle is totally healthy, they turn out to have been sexually abused and are in horrible denial about it.   Actually, it's predictable.

Enough "Simpsons did it" bullshit, kthx. We already know.
I met my boyfried on WoW.  We're 1000 miles apart doing the whole visiting thing until I can move to where he lives.  It's the hardest thing to be apart, but for me it's the easiest thing to stay together.  It's definitely not for everyone though.
Not only does it slow the system down running two background scanners, they can lock up the system at times and corrupt files. This is one of the biggest no-nos of running Antivirus software.  Dump McAfee. Actully, dump both. Both are no better than Norton for system resource usage. McAfee has really poor detection rates (and a high false positive rate) and is much more prone to breaking the entire system than Norton. And AVG is lacking full scanning for rootkits which has become fairly popular. You're choking the life out of your poor machine.    Also, Malwarebytes is a good program but is not a virus scanner. It is a spyware scanner like SuperAntiSpyware or Spybot. I have seen it pick up a virus here and there, it is no where near as good as a real virus scanner for finding the much more complex and damaging infections.

If every Fox News show featured anchors acting this competent for a change, I might be tempted to watch.

Yeah, the Epitaph 2 recap was bad, but the ones halfway through the season referenced some pretty specific stuff from the first season, which made them worth skimming.

Six million seems a little high. Just sayin'.
Well we can help you with alot of it, but really it depends on how much you play. I've seen people go from 1-80 in a month, and also in a year. Its all about how dedicated you are to it
Woah, I pass this on the way to USF every day. I also am friends with one of the former residents there.   Interesting.
No I knew that, my point was that it didn't help them much. In fact their best chances of winning come from practice and becoming more disciplined. 
I didn't know of that one until I started watching The Sopranos box set.
Yes, I am pissed.
I always say "PC load letter? What the fuck does that mean?" when my printer stops working (which is often). 
Sick! Just tried it out, I do miss the building/Mod aspect of the Tribes 1 though D:
Awesome! I stand corrected.
oddly enough, most companies have a 'send a self addressed stamped envelope and we'll send you stickers' thing going on.  I learned this through mtn.biking companies.  or check your local head shop.
I can relate.  A month passes between and you really wonder what is wrong with *me*?   What did I do?  Is it my looks?  My performance?    I just wanna scream WTF!  
When the average person hasn't even heard of Asus, lenovo, ect. that's how. Apple is a marketing god. They could reinvent a camcorder and the average consumer would assume that it's the best thing around. 
You're right.  I don't know what he meant. 
It's just good parenting to maintain boundaries
Actually, I have a smirk on my face.
no problem. yea, most are cheesy :P
&gt;  Demand never went down on a price increase.          So why didn't you just jack up all of your prices?  Prove to me that that demand does not respond to changes in price, and I will give you a nobel prize in economics.     Also, a customer doesn't need to purchase a bundle of fresh spinach instead of potato chips to be healthy.  Simply not buying the potato chips is likely a better nutritional choice.  
What does he do for a living?

We can argue all day about who said what, and who shot who. But in the end we can all agree, it is a catchy song.

I watched that in the theatre when I was way too young. I didn't get it then.  Then I watched it on acid many years later.  I also didn't get it then, but it was damn freaky.  And finally I watched it again a few years ago.  I still don't get it.  I love it, but that movie is beyond my capacity for understanding.
6 months!?  I like to get it out of the way earlier to see if she has any potential.  Your quality of farts will diminish greatly in 6 months time.
ok, here's the deal:   If someone reposts, and it gets upvoted, it mean that people either haven't seen it or still enjoy it.  Reddit is a wonderfully democratic system, and as such it has this thing called the "downvote" which allows you to express your disapproval for items you have already seen.  If enough people are upset that the same item has been reposted, the item will get downvoted and will not show up.  My point is, commenting "repost" will not magically make this post go away or dissuade people who haven't seen it from posting it in the future, so I see no point to it other than to whore karma from people who are just as obsessive about reposts as you.
STALKER. Just kidding. We obviously share a brain.  I tend to lose count when the number goes over 6 or 7. At that point, my brain has turned to much, and I am completely indebted to my vagina. 
I'm envisioning something like a small laptop desk that can unfold and be placed at a good angle for using the iPad, but the sides can be folded in and the whole thing collapses to a fairly thin, portable thing. Or, you know, a three-ring binder. One of those would probably put it at a good angle, too. You don't want this thing standing up, like a laptop screen would be, but at an angle where you can type comfortably. I think a binder would work nicely for that, but I obviously haven't tried it out.
Well played sir. You won this round.

My bro was pretty crazy for cs for a time. I remember when he bought huge speakers and it actually sounded like a real war zone in the basement ALL THE DAMN TIME.
&gt; It's definitely cheaper and faster than trying to teach the majority of them basic economics.  Basic economics? By Satan's cross, I'd settle for having them understand the Constitution they swore by their worthless faggot-God to preserve and protect, and for having them actually *read* the bills they pass.
ZING!
That's what I always thought!!
&gt; How? Basically, it’s slow as hell. It uses a variant of the Blowfish encryption algorithm’s keying schedule, and introduces a work factor, which allows you to determine how expensive the hash function will be. Because of this, bcrypt can keep up with Moore’s law. As computers get faster you can increase the work factor and the hash will get slower.
it didn't go to plaid.. so 
It has to be a really good job to move here.   Can you elaborate?
I just apt-got it, and it works fine. There's a mode where you can annotate your code using declarators and it runs both as Python and Cython, but sometimes you need to refactor your code a bit to get the most speedup.  There's also a module that allows you to just import a pyx file and it will compile it in the background, falling back to pure Python code if that fails. It's pretty fantastic.
Well said.

You gotta make due man. Just about every weekend we'd do a 2+ hour bus and subway ride to get to this one arcade in another city.  We did it because they were the only ones in this province who had Beatmania, guitar freaks, drum mania and popnmusic.
No, they look like ugly gorilla feet. Human feet aren't ugly.  Segway? Because walking is too hard?
You have to register as a "partner" to be able to do it... it's free.
Yes, the health effects are dramatically reduced, if not removed. Its vaporized liquid, and you do exhale vapor. It looks like smoke, except there's less of it. Its also legal to smoke anywhere and does not smell. I'm "smoking" (they call it "vaping" online) on my gf's couch right now. She is here and does not mind, and has never smoked a cig.
Being submissive is very attractive to most masculine men.
I don't either. Although I can see why some people would.  Depending on how much you earn, you can qualify for matching contributions from the federal government, and there are lower taxes on super earnings (although I'm far from an expert on this!). As you say, it just comes at the price of not being able to get at it when you want.

*spoilers*   My fave? Mordin. The conversation on the Krogan homeworld during his personal mission was extremely well-done and fleshed him out beautifully. I really hope he manages to come back for ME3 (I'm assuming he doesn't die, still playing, about to get Legion).   I was also extremely happy to see Wrex and find that he really did get a chance to unite some of his people's clans.  
he doesn't need all girls, he just has to find 2.
That's nature's pocket.

Seconded! Jesus...
Unfortunately, Kona is an expensive coffee.  It's a supply and demand thing so the price will always stay high whether it's profitable to grow or not.  Assuming you're really getting 100% Kona, $30 per pound is a decent price for the mainland.  100% Kona is difficult to find outside of Hawaii.  If you're paying $30 for a Kona Blend though, then you're actually just overpaying for a cheap non-Kona coffee.  I charge $25 per pound and that's the farm direct price.  Any cheaper and I would be giving the coffee away for less than it costs to grow.  There are plenty of people that don't like Kona coffee but there are also plenty of people that do.  So you'll have to make up your own mind whether or not it's worth the price.  On a side note, can you get me the name of your roaster?  I'm hoping I can get them to buy their green beans from me rather than whoever they're currently using.  They're probably happy with their current supplier but in this economy it's worth asking. 
I am. I just bought an XXXL wolf shirt and it is already getting kind of snug.
I don't think anybody put a  gun to your friend's head asking them to ingest heroin..  I think the solution is education and regulation

Maybe not where you are but in Australia stray, feral and even domesticated cats are a menace to the native wildlife. Sure there are introduced birds that cause problems too like the Indian Mynar and the Starling but not a lot can be done about those.  The issue is this. Cats are _domesticated animals_. By all means have a cat as a pet and do the responsible things like having your pet desexed and vaccinated and keep it inside at night.  Stray cats, ie. those who have been neglected and/or abandoned by humans are a huge problem and should not be fed or housed (unless you are prepared to fully adopt and take responsibility for)... I have trapped and shot many stray cats and know that it does not take long for a cat to become wild. One they are wild there really is no alternative but to destroy them.
lol, ok geek talk ... Sims 2 is better in sooooo many ways ... but sims 3 is better in other :)
Perhaps you mean 'ignore the guy who has a difference in opinion because I think weed is cool regardless of how it damages society'.  Here's an example of why it's illegal, when I was younger the weed dealer next door had a junkie son and another 4 year old that would rub (literally) shit onto the walls and she would let the 4 year old run about on the street in an area known to be littered with perverts and pedophiles yet the mother was too stoned all the time to give a crap.  It's all cool when your 16 and watching cheech and chong but it doesn't end there mate.
That's amazing. Really.
I did not see any overt hate or anything for those that are atheist or of not so mainstream religions (wiccan etc) but i did see a lot of frowning upon people that are Muslim. Did i see anyone get beat up for being Muslim, no, but many people i was with had the idea that Muslim=possible risk. 
A lot science fiction, thinking specifically of Heinlein, deals with unusual families.

That's IF you saved Kelly by going for collectors as SOON as the crew is taken.

Kelly has a nice outfit and dance though :)
Wait a minute...
I guess we'll just have to disagree and watch to see what happens.
If you were driving AND holding the coffee AND it was stick-shift, then I'd be impressed.

Yea, that was pretty fuckin awesome...

Being paid well isn't recognition enough?  Or a nice bonus at the end of the year?  I'm past the point of giving a shit about pats on the back.  I do the job I'm paid to do to the best of my ability and I expect to be compensated to meet the going market rates. 
It looks a lot like dust or fingerprints being iluminated by the camera flash
Watch your back, then, good sir - you are likely to be kidnapped by the makers of Axe, and kept in a cold, dark basement lab as your pheremones are collected and analyzed.  Good luck!

I had a cousin back in 2003 die in a bus bombing in Jerusalem, Hamas took credit for it. He wasn't a jew, he wasn't a settler he was an innocent civilian studying at the university.   These people are terrorists who KILL INNOCENT PEOPLE!   If they were waging a war for liberty by fighting soldiers and policemen then they get my vote. But NO, They attack the weakest who cannot defend themselves. And two wrongs do not make a right under any circumstances. 
Absolutely, and we're on the moral high ground to joke about classiness, because the joke about people with intellectual disabilities in this submission was the absolute pinnacle of classiness.
I don't know, some people prefer to be alone most of the time. I thought it may have been possible you were just sort of one of those people.
That's how it always happens with good jobs, from what i've seen that is.
Ooo, interesting. Thanks!
Which one of us is self-righteous? Your goal is to get *toned*. I'm offering you advice about how to become *strong* and *balanced*, which may one day save your *life* in case your boat is ever subjected to fast acceleration. If I'm self-righteous, it's because I object to anti-science mysticism, whether manifested in magical claims about yoga's alleged efficacy or belief in a 6000 year old earth.   If my rhetorical approach was condescending, that was unintentional and I apologize for my neanderthal discourse. Best of luck in choosing a training methodology that makes you feel spiritually fulfilled.
Leave now.
I believe that person would probably find comfort and justification in their faith through modern theology. Unfortunately, the fundamentals of Christianity require a certain amount of Faith, aka - the absence of skepticism. He/she would simply be attracted to the most new-age and logically sound(ing) explanations for The Bible. Of course, modern theology is also nonsense and ultimately less worthwhile to debate.  Also, people are weird and do a lot shit for reasons that don't make sense.
I think you're saying this to the wrong people.
Same, almost two years clean. Only have 5 lvl 70s (3 DPS, Warrior Tank, Druid Healer). One of these days I'm going to relapse, especially with you all reminding me of it constantly. I'd have to pay to realm change though, if I wanted to join the reddit guild.

Well I am sorry to hear how jaded you seem to be. I really can't comment about your vague nameless european state and what it's history is, but what I do know is that it does take selfless people to put their lives on the line in any situation to try to help someone they don't even know. This is where I pull out my asshole card and remind you that if it wasn't for selfless Canadian soldiers amongst many others who knows what regime Europe would be living under.   One last thing, do not confuse Canadian soldiers with our cousins to the south, you may want to look into some of our peackeeping history as well before you decide how irrelevant we can be.

&gt;violate the sovereignty of Switzerland  And Switzerland/UBS broke no laws in regards to US tax evasion? The US is basically playing hardball. I have no problem with that. At least we didn't invade them like the multiple countries we have already. Any country we have a military base on is a violation of that country's sovereignty.  &gt;only to gain a few short-term political points.  in your opinion. I believe it will be positive in the long term. If a country knowingly breaks US laws or actively looks the other way, we will prosecute them to the fullest extent.
But what happens when you catch all 151?  You end up using a select few, while the other Pocket Monsters, who once enjoyed frolicking in the green green grasses, stay cooped up in Bill's PC, awaiting that day where you once again let them out and show them love.

&gt;I am not anti-semetist nor do I pretend anything! I am Canadian,  So you hate Jews, but since you are Canadian you can't be an anti-Semite. I don't see how that was supposed to make sense.  &gt;If canadians started invading Denmark, or the US  So what would Canadians do if Greenland started sending people with vest bombs into PEI? What if they started launching missiles at Newfoundland? It is your admitted bigotry that enables you to only look at Israel's actions and not see that Israel is reacting to Hamas and Fatah.  
Oh, so that makes it ok. 
aawww poor thechazard = ( That sucks.  Unfortunately we were used to people having sex at the resort.  They were seriously like 16 year old kids.  There was a couple in the pool and she was straddling him and they were having calm sex.  I was shocked when they called me over to order some drinks.
I have a plan, but it involves bringing the Village People out of retirement.
&gt; The pulling force is along the direction of the rope.  THIS is the reason why, and you need to make it clearer in your drawing:  If the ropes are *tied together* at the handles (as they appear in your drawing), then there will be no apparent increase in force, as the pulling force is in the direction of motion.  If the ropes are *held separately* (as your calculations assume), then there *will* be an apparent increase in force, because the normal force exerted by each bag/sled on the other is transmitted through the ropes to your hands, which then must work *against* each other to keep the sleds in horizontal equilibrium.  Lesson 1: don't assume, lest you make an ass out of u and me.  Lesson 2: if you want to make your two kids in two sleds weigh less, tie the ropes together.
Ugh... It seems I am responding to you for a second time tonight. Sorry. But I feel (or don't feel) the same way. People dying generally doesn't bother me. I loved my grandfathers and had a very close relationship with each of them and when they died it didn't tear me up.   That said, I do get a little bent out of shape when I lose a dog or a favorite musician - no matter what the age. However this only lasts a day or two. I am not sure what kind of asshole this makes me. 
Hahah, I am sorry I ruined the shit surprise!

Awesome!  Is that your site?  Starting to read the linked book but no time tonight.
Who gives a fuck what Obama *knows* about the constitution if he is violating it on multiple fronts? What you are implying is idiotic: that since he "knows" it he will surely follow it. That is **not** the case.  Warrantless wiretapping definitely violates our constitutional right to privacy. And Obama fully supports it. And that's just one example of multiple laws he is currently violating as president. I voted for him; I am beyond disappointed.  I don't care to argue this further; but I will say that you seem confused between what Obama says and what he actually does. Good luck with that. Whatever helps you sleep at night.
This is a bad thing? Non-Jews don't do this? It's called frugality.

I'm in the econ program at CMU (central michigan). I disagree with the statement that an MA only useful if you didn't get a BA in it. That being said, my undergrad isn't econ. At the time, LSSU didn't have an Econ BA. I still took every econ class they offered (except one - it was offered at the same time as the price is right - gotta have priorities). Without at least some econ background, CMU's MA program would be insanely difficult if not a death wish. I know here at CMU they have really revamped the program to much higher standards in the last year so that might not hold true everywhere.  I feel bad for anyone here who hasn't had at least intermediate (3 or 400) level micro and macro.  :)
You can do it right now.
No company, freelance (I don't actively search for jobs though-- just through meeting people they kind of find me).

Well, a lot of people seem to think of Monsanto as this big bad guy, but in reality these companies are quite large. To villianize just Monsanto over all the problems that come Agribusiness is scapegoating. Dow Agrochemicals, BASF, Bayer, all of them engage in the same practices.   To people like me, the real issue is that Monsanto creates most of it's legal problems by being so cutting edge.   As for people like me, who sell the products. It's really a matter of preferences the farmer has and making sure we are doing our job controlling weed/insect problems and really chemical controls is just one thing we have in our arsenal to improve yields.
I know it sounds terrible. To be honest, I despise swiss cheese in any other context.  Together, it is quite simply the greatest creation ever.

You know, same old stuff. "It's too complicated to come out of nowhere!"  [I found a great link](http://www.emc.maricopa.edu/faculty/farabee/BIOBK/BioBookcircSYS.html), it blew my mind. But now I just want to learn more. Did you know that amphibians circulate both oxygenated AND deoxygenated blood? They have a three-chambered heart, and a four-chambered heart found in reptiles is a byproduct of natural selection attempting to fix this problem to increase efficiency! But I want to know the fine details, not the gist of it if possible.
In seriousness, then you are one of the few that can really get away with this - it's likely that your body just doesn't cause any unpleasant smell.  No doubt you still smell, because we ALL do, but it's just not causing the 'disgust' reaction.  Rock on, but make sure the ladies you spend your time with will be honest enough to tell you if that ever changes for the worse.
Hah. I would believe that if people didn't edit their comment with: "Why all the downvotes? Blah blah blah" only to get upvotes to compensate.
&gt;if you want to find links relevant to some topic then you need to start using google without a "site:reddit.com" specifier.  That does nothing.  That will return every single link that contains a comment about the word being searched.  That would be a very very retarded way to try to find links/topics that have the word haiti in them.  If you did it by keyword and titles, when you search haiti you will only get topics/links/threads where the link is about haiti.  If I wanted to find random comments about haiti, google would work great.  But if I want to find links/topics/threads(all the same thing on reddit) google would be a terrible way.  I would need to search titles for the word haiti and hopefully links without the word haiti in the topic have the keyword haiti attached to them for search purposes.  I do find it funny that you are repeating something that is a blatantly terrible way to search.

The point of changing a public key is not so that an adversary causes things not to verify,  but rather as part of an eavesdropping attempt or even to send things fraudulently.   Sending things fraudulently would be the easiest exploit to pull off in this context.
Oh, remember this is Reddit - 12 year olds rule here.
What do they sue for? On what grounds?
Oh thanks.  No wonder my memory was vague...bad movie.
I think so.  The first one with the discussion about deleting emails and discussion about the guy who kept trying to get the raw data having died.
:-)
Never mind. Thanks anyway!
How much are you required to tell a person before it becomes a lie of omission?  Do you need to tell about having an affair? If so, do you need to tell the person in detail what that affair consisted of? Is merely saying "having an affair" sufficient, or would you also need to detail it with "we kissed and explained romantic flirtations" vs. "we had sex, including oral and anal penetration."    In the original example (she said she was masturbating), was that relevant for him to know? She just needed to say she was busy.    Also, it was really just a poor writing choice by going for the obvious toilet humor. They might have had her say something like she was scarfing down a pizza so she wouldn't be so hungry at dinner and be perceived as a pig.
That is a lot of playtime for l4d. I usually get bored of it after a while, though come back from time to time to shoot some zombies.
the guy i got em' from originally is going to check his work computer for them, so hopefully he still has them. 
You keep using that word. I do not think it means what you think it means.
That's a bit of a given when you move here.  You discover Brooklyn has it's own brewery and you end up sampling their full selection.  It's usually what I get at a bar if it's on tap because the brewery is right down the street.
&gt; (you must use the same type of yeast)  Not true.  Many breweries filter their beer and then use a second strain for bottle conditioning.

I remember watching the Simpsons and Homer makes a comment that he doesn't want to go into the sewers because that's where the C.H.U.Ds live.  I was like, "wow, I can't believe anybody else saw that movie!"
You might be a bit surprised to find out all of what your military does when it isn't just being the sharp end of a spear. Have a look into the Army coprs of engineers and consider the mississippi river.

I am pretty sure that the insurance company covers this charge.  What was pretty cool is the fire fighters got together and actually tried to give my parents money to help them out.  My parents had them donate it to an organization that benefits the spouse's of Marines that have lost their lives in Iraq/Afghanistan.

Except that the high levels of Omega 6 relative to Omega 3 in corn-fed beef and farmed salmon probably are bad for you, so stick with grass-fed beef and wild salmon, which have much better ratios.
If you don't give a shit, why are you so pissed off? If you really didn't give a shit, and only cared about blah, blah, blah, you'd repost it again and again without bitching and whining.  But you've missed the point completely. The point is, we KNOW, we've already seen what you're selling and we bought it from someone else who packaged it better.
Funny how they don't make controllers that give you blisters so much anymore. Kind of a *you should really stop playing now* mechanism (or not, amirite?).

I think the last time this one was posted it was torn apart by his pessimism, but i do agree with you on this, it's a lot of luck
&gt;The opposite can also occur, where there is a shortage of labor, as often occurs in booming economies.  I may be blissfully unaware, but could you point to me a time in history where there has been a shortage of unskilled labor, thus implying full employment? &gt;The 'bargaining power' evens out in the long run between the employer and the consumer.  What do you mean, exactly?
So is compromising my sexual preferences (I wanna have sex) for the sake of convenience (guess I'll masturbate).
We don't tolerate people killing people for the purposes of food but we also realize that if the person is already dead and it means living or dying you do what you must.    Is everything less intelligent then us fair game, no but I would say everything less sentient than us.  When someone says whales are highly intelligent that usually means they are highly intelligent for animals.  I wouldn't consider even a whale or dolphin equal to any person.  I'd try eating whale because there is really nothing culturally to stop me from doing so and I see them as just another animal albeit a smart one.
I will try this tomorrow.......
IIRC, the "aliens" aren't aliens at all; they're demons. The girl was blessing all of those glasses and making it holy water. I still can't explain the "swing away" crap though...
All but Carnivale, YES!  Every time I saw those crazy depression-era carnies, I felt totally confused.  And wasn't there magic?  Magic isn't real.  
Given their stance on Judaism, who knows.  But better yet, to line up with the absurdist counter-protesting, put on a KKK outfit and carry a sign that says "These people are out of their F*&amp;#ing minds." Or maybe even a "I was promised donuts" sign if you don't want to draw attention to them.
You can go on with your idealistic thinking all you want, but realistically, it's never going to happen, so sorry, I'm not willing to give up the $300+ dollars that I make in credit card rewards a year, plus the safety and security of using a credit card, just to try to fix a problem that isn't ever going to be fixed.  
You're welcome.

I may have had Bluepoint before but I don't quite remember.  It was probably from one of the many times I've been at a bar with a number of beers on tap and it happens to be at the end after I've gone through everything before it.  I'll put it near the top next time I see it.
It's Denny's version of a scrambled egg, ham, and grilled cheese sandwich!

Yes, nobody put the gun to my friend's head. However, I do not believe he was educated enough about the consequences, nor do I believe anyone is. I do not believe I have ever heard of a regular user of Heroin who has been in control over their drug habits.  After all, being educated is not a solve-all for stupid decisions. Peer pressure is a very powerful influence on people, whether we admit it or not. Additionally, people are naive. They can be educated to any point about the risks of ingesting something, and yet still do it because they are young and thus invulnerable to what's otherwise dangerous to everyone else.  I respect your opinion, however I find it misguided. I think your outlook on the world is far too trusting of people to make the right decisions.
that's terrible! I'm so sorry that happened to you. I've heard that Lasik really isn't that bad though. Have you ever had an appointment where they used eye drops to numb your eyes to do a test for glaucoma? That stuff lasts a long time, and any feeling in your eye is completely gone. 
A hairy spider as large as your hand (including outstretched fingers) is on the ceiling, father standing on a ladder below the spider.  Father attempts to trap spider with a plastic bucket only slightly larger than the spiders leg span.  A child watches on and admonishes her daddy to "be careful".  Imagine the worst possible outcome to this story and add screaming like a little girl, arm waving. 
How is that amazing?

Oh, well, that solves that.
I think I am going to talk to her but go in without expectations.  I'll give her some time and hopefully this can be talked out but if it can't be, I still have a lot to be thankful for and I'll just keep breathing.
If you can manage to die in bed (always iffy, I haven't been able to give up motorcycling yet) and select the Cadillac of cryonics companies (Alcor), they do have various levels of standby, including flying you out to Arizona so they can vitrify you immediately when you're on your deathbed.  It's sort of the opposite of Valhalla.

That's hilarious, my job was looking for Ruby "Rock Stars" a few months back and every single person that came in with ror experience wanted to make as much as a VP and didn't even have a solid CS background. For me rocks stars are something like Jeff Han not web framework end users.
If it's not too intrusive, what are you doing now in Argentina?  Why did you guys move there?
My parents are members there! Luckily this is something they only do there on the weekends! They kept it a secret from my brother and I for quite some time. But the little investigators we were, we found out before they had the guts to tell us. Since then, my brother has even gone with them a few times.
&gt;The end of story is this, if you give anyone the opportunity to do a brute hack, then you are doomed. You must never reveal the hashed password, salts or allow someone to repetitively request wrong information without any kind of "increasing" span.  By this logic we may as well store passwords in plain text.  Clearly our protections will always be perfect, right?  The entire point of hashing passwords is that if shit hits the fan and someone *does* manage to read the password database, you're still not 100% fucked.

Sorry if I'm infringing on the OP, but I got my medical card in Colorado by taking one hour on a Friday and walking into an office that is licensed to give them out.  I didn't need an appointment, medical records, or anything. I basically paid them $90 and they asked me what I needed my card for and I told them I had severe migraines a few times a year. The doctor didn't even blink an eye and promptly approved my application.  Seriously, don't even fret about thinking you won't get your card. I definitely don't have migraines or anything else wrong with my for that matter and I walked in and out of that place within an hour.   Do it soon before the state tries to change some laws. It is ridiculously easy to get your medical card in Colorado right now.  EDIT: If you're curious about the place I went to, feel free to PM me. It's in downtown Denver on Colfax. I've heard though that it doesn't matter where you go, it's always as easy.

It's weird that they'd have gotten rid of so many body issues but that one stayed. I mean is there really any difference in a guy having an erection and using a towel that gives an outline and might as well be a giant sign saying he has an erection?
I'm not proud. That was on a news channel. That belongs on Jerry Springer. 
I've never actually seen that before, but it doesn't come as a surprise if someone else has suggested the integral thing. It's the mathematically sane choice.  &gt; Regardless, the only point that I would advocate my own death, is if I am brain-dead and can no longer experience anything anyway.  Honestly, I have a hard time believing that, but if it's true, then either a) you're irrational, or b) you value even negative experience more than you fear pain/death.  &gt; I'm not afraid of death. Just like I'm not afraid of the time before I was born.  Agreed. I do, however, fear pain, and since I don't fear death, it would be a convenient way to get out of pain if I thought a lot was headed my way.
huh.  does it smell?
haha, what a sly boots.  i'm sure the googles could help?
Oh, you. I see what you did there. Claiming that you have a girlfriend. 
seconed. homeboys of any color are usually worth shit in general. I had one talking about tipping as if I asked hm if he like eating a girl on her period.  The fucker was sitting there, chewing his straw saying "It says free delivery on the window, if I tip it ain't free".  Black people in general will run you like a dog and then tip horribly. I had one guy pay me for a group order and the people left the tip money in an envelope. He had the fucking nerve to open it, count it, and try to keep the extra cash. I had to point out that the envelope had the pizza price and the tip amount on it. I found out later they did that because he tried to do that shit all the time.
I personally like Digsby for when I'm in Windows, works fine for me.  But I'm not up my own ass about this shit like the rest of Reddit, so I don't really care if you prefer Live Messenger.  Whatever works for you.

My point is that all journalist are susceptible to self censorship. I don't think that the entire news industry is damned, but I think it is important to consider the influence that funding has on the reporting from our media outlets. I think it is foolish to ignore the potential influences say that they are good people; therefore, they wouldn't give in.
I don't understand the logic behind naming such kitchens thusly. Did they go into it in any great detail? I am wondering if I should take that class...

You're absolutely right, I have t as the variable but I was taking the antiderivative with respect to b for some reason. Goodness I'm rusty.  Thanks!

"Built from the ground up" basically means it chucks out Gnome, in this case. It's still 100% based on Ubuntu, there are just heavy modifications to make it slimmer. UNR is basically a fusion of Ubuntu and Moblin.  I have not tried UNR or Moblin because they are only designed for the Intel Atom processor, and mine is a Celeron. They could both be very well what the netbook market needs, but more companies putting out products is never a bad thing. UNR/Moblin for developers/creators, iPad for consumers, why is this so terrible?

What's your definition of terrorism?  I use the US Army's definition.  For background on me, I am a white atheist US citizen.  I don't strongly identify with the Christian or European background I came from, but I'm not ashamed of it.

Utd fan here. In Gallas' defense he was really their only threat once they pushed forward. He is pretty remarkable in the air. I was biting my nails the last 20 minutes when Arsenal put together some quality passing moves and played crosses into the box with the likes of Gallas and Vermaelen being the only guys who can attack a header for the Gunners. I mean shit, they played a short squad!
Just to stay sharp on my evolutionary theory. It's not for them as much as it is for me.   This person actually believes plate tectonics is dependent on continents floating on water... there's no way I can get through that force field.

This is a serious debate among liberal (theologically and/or politically) Christians right now.  It's partly got to do with that whole "humility" gig, which has bitten us in the ass over and over again. Is it better for us to do nothing, and see our entire understanding of our faith suffer for it? Or is it better to display qualities like pride and wrath in our faith, which run counter to it?  If I were to choose one single exemplar of this being done right, it would be MLK. But, to greatly understate, I am no MLK.  Also, I live in Minneapolis, and we're well-represented here.

If you look on the [list of previous winners](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Sundance_Film_Festival_award_winners), Special Jury Prizes are often somewhat random. There doesn't seem to be much rhyme or reason for their awardance (word?); almost seems like a tacked on category. The two big categories seem to be the Grand Jury Prizes and the Audience Awards; those are the best movies, as chosen by the Jury and the General Audience.

When did the iPad claim to be a full computer? Jobs said he wanted a device that would blend the iPod Touch and a computer together. Notice he didn't say "I wanted a computer with a touch screen". The iPad, from it's very conception, was meant to be a computing appliance, a consumer device, not meant for doing your taxes or running bittorrent. It's the same exact thing as an Xbox. It's an entertainment device. I haven't seen any example of Jobs saying the iPad is meant to do everything a normal computer can do, he's only said it can do everything a normal *consumer* needs from their computer.

I was thinking of mentioning how it seems that the only ones who morally oppose assisted suicide are the religious, who consider it a way of spitting in the great face of God and his magical gift of life but I considered that sort of counter-productive and not on the point, which is that Terry Pratchett deserves to choose whether he goes out with a bang or a whimper.

When you think about it is pretty barbaric.   In terms of sensitivity I've heard numbers as high as 50%, which is nothing compared to those that are permanently scarred, disfigured or cannot achieve an erection.   Even if those who suffer from adverse effects are a fraction of a %, imagine if that was you.   Those who restore claim the new sensation is a huge deal and a major improvement.

My first sip of Arrogant Bastard wasn't exactly what I expected so I was thrown off a bit.  I don't even know what I expected.  But about halfway through the pint I started to really enjoy it.  The flavor was really rich, I think that's what it was that threw me off at first.  I enjoyed the shit out of it by the final sip and that's what pissed me off about having to switch back to PBR.  PBR has it's own flavor that I'm fully willing to say is good if it's the only thing you're drinking but if you have something flavorful before it, *fahget about it*.  I've seen both Smuttynose and Dogfish Head at my supermarket.  I'll bump them up the list of things to try for next time.  Victory just *sounds* awesome but I don't think I've seen it.

thank you for your sincere input. i would like to start couples counseling as soon as possible, but unfortunately, neither of us have the funds or insurance to afford it right now. As soon as we do, I will definitely be taking your advice.
apparently it costs around $150  http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/aw7vl/iama_foreskin_restoration_device_tech_former_i/  glad I could help
As demonstrated here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0b_ruLfFERQ&amp;feature=related  Thanks How I Met Your Mother!
Because it encourages education. An educated society is a better society. Just my opinion.

I'd like to try it before I pay 50 dollars for it.
&gt;And Switzerland/UBS broke no laws in regards to US tax evasion?  If the money leaves the US and goes to a foreign country, the US loses jurisdiction. Just like when a person leaves the US, the US loses jurisdiction unless the foreign government agrees to extradition.  &gt;If a country knowingly breaks US laws or actively looks the other way, we will prosecute them to the fullest extent.  The US doesn't have the right to prosecute other countries, because all other countries are supposed to be equally sovereign to the United States, unless you follow some form of weird American exceptionalism, which apparently you do. What gives the US government the right to impose its law on other countries, in the jurisdiction of the other countries?
I don't think they are evil so much as 1990's.  Anyone still publishing for the web in pdf format is taking a huge hit in readership.  Very rarely is there a good reason for it, especially as most of the pdf's can be converted with little loss to html format.
My roommate is from Bangladesh. The only thing he's really mentioned to me about Sharia laws is that the penalty for drinking is getting flogged. I'm also unsure if it's applied to only muslims or everyone, because I've read online that foreigners can drink in Bangladesh, but that it's expensive as hell.

Why bother moving when technology can do the work for you?  And people wonder why they're fat.
That is true, i clearly had not seen that point,  i stand corrected

Lost.... has completely gone off its rocker. I've watched all the seasons and I still have no idea what the fuck is going on. It was a very good show, but now... what the fuck? 
Do you have any evidence to that effect? 
Yea, I'm sure I'm going to love it, I'm just really busy and know how much time I'm going to spend playing it after I open it.  Yea, demo's are good but I'll get pissed if I like the demo but the game ends up being really short so I could've just rented it.
mainly to show that people are going to fuck themselves up no matter the legality of something. as for heroin, making it illegal just forced the users into unregulated underworld black-market hell. 
Definitely not true.
that's basically it.  it works surprisingly well in practice, and everyone knows that this is what will happen if they leave their laundry for ages, but unlike the grace-period-before-approved-dumping, noone has any real reason to get offended. and it definitely improves throughput a-la Little's law.

I love the Daily show, I just think its disturbing when people get opinions and hear about bits of news for the first time from the show. Although, for this, it probably wouldn't matter.
&gt;Much of the film was shot in and around Peter Jackson's home town of Pukerua Bay, north of Wellington, New Zealand. Originally begun as a short film, Bad Taste was shot primarily on weekends over the course of four years, at a total cost of around $25,000. Toward the end of the shoot the New Zealand Film Commission invested around NZ$235,000 into the film to ensure its completion.  [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bad_Taste)  NZFC came on board once the film was virtually completed. So yeah, you're technically right, the best kind of right.

Glad you (and your roommates) enjoyed them! As for the baking soda, I'm curious to know what your elevation is... I'm in Denver, which is part of the reason that I tend to use less, but also, through trial and error (and continuing to cut the amount down) I've found that anything more than a pinch just makes them too fluffy and cakey. I too enjoy a nice chewy, gooey cookie. :P  If you have a moment, would you be willing to post your volume conversions here? I haven't had the time I'd thought (school) to make another batch, and I know there are some here who don't have the option of weighing the ingredients.
Switch to Ctrl-R only when absolutely necessary.  
pretty much sums it up for me.  it can be wonderful. but it does require a good bit of communication. i've only ever explored it within a long-term relationship, so that wasn't a problem.  with girls I don't know as well, it's sort of a very gentle, playful maybe-a-little kinda thing.    also, i read somewhere, concerning anus-to-mouth contact, that it only takes about 2 months of regular sexual contact with a single partner for the two of you to share mostly the same anal flora, that is, bacteria and such.

Looks like there's a decent amount of art but little to no *game*.  I'd say we can wait a minimum 6-9 months before we see a release.  Also, the forums are hilarious.  [A GIRL WORKING ON A GAME?!  MUST HIT ON IT](http://www.primalcarnage.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=22&amp;t=6).

Then you're resting on the assumption that society or the State has a prior claim to all the land, property, and individuals in a given geographic area.
As a computer engineer, I can imagine we can make some ridiculous computers well beyond anything we can comprehend for one. I don't have anything specific though.  One thing I'm wondering is if it will allow us to violate causality (e.g. FTL speed, time travel, etc.) or anything weird from our point of view. I just don't know enough about it to say for sure though.
You have just made my games so much more interesting.

The US census lumps a lot of groups together when it is convenient.  Such as "African-Americans" include groups from all over (immigrants and slave decedents).  So that isn't a good standard.    WHITE Americans are Anglo-Saxon Protestants.  This excludes Eastern Europeans (particularly Romanians/Poles/Czech/Slovac), Middle Eastern peoples (also mostly Caucasian), and Mediterranean Europeans (Greeks, Italians, Spanish).  These groups are not privileged groups in the US, lumping an working class ethnic Polish-American with the upper class WASP is not correct. 
For the Avante-Garde question, it's actually stuff that was uploaded for my noise/drone/electroacoustic show that's being kept out of some of the Everything blocks.  Everything else is getting in.  Personal playlists, would be an awesome idea for the future, but we have only enough money currently for about the next three months to pay for the space and bandwidth running a 24/7 high-quality 128k mp3 stream up.

Lately I've been having issues with paying attention to things and My ability to play computer games has suffered. So I figured it's best that I wait until I can play well before trying to play. Because, I can't even do well in Sims 2 because I keep drifting away from it.
It isn't denial. Even my shrink agrees with me. His behaviour was not appropriate, but I did what I wanted to. Part of the reason I did what I did was so he would like me, and once again if that means I was abused so are most women who engage in casual sex.  At one time or another. If you are talking to a woman you have a 38% chance she was raped before she was 16. http://www.womenofsubstance.org/sexabuse.htm Those are the statistics. Lets pretend your right, I am in horrible denial about my abuse. What is unhealthy about exploring those feelings in a consensual relationship? Gee that could even sound like therapy? Isn't therapy healthy? I made no claims that I or the lifestyle is healthy (I believe it is, but then I consider polygamy, polyamory, homosexuality,and drug use moral, not to mention abortion, birth control, and evolution. you can disagree) (edit)The irony that you want me to be a victim does not escape me.

Because Einstein wasn't the only one to benefit from his study of physics.  Decreasing the cost of college encourages more people to go, increasing the expected number of advances in just about every field.  It's a reasonable investment for society to make.

Yeah, I'm now wondering if I overestimated the interest level (or underestimated my fellow redditors).  The hype is infectious.  Hopefully, people just aren't checking the subreddit regularly since there's been so little activity around here so far.  If I don't get more responses soon, I'll open it up to everybody.  I was going to try to start a GIF-style group trade with one growler and do a serious trade with the other, but I figured there wasn't time to form a good group and this would be more fun.

Oh bollocks to that. I just *did* tell the rest of the world that they should shut up. A very brief google about WBC brought me plenty of articles referencing Christian ministers of various denominations that turn up to their 'protests' and attempt do discuss the error of their ways with them.  Stop trying to justify your own bigotry by holding up the strawman of one small group of cranks and then hiding behind them.

I specifically mentioned siberian ginseng.. even going so far as to give a direct link to a powered whole root product.

Haha. Thanks! I'm pretty new to Reddit but I have learned from other forums/boards that you will get verbally abused until you cry if you repost a previous topic.
=S not too many redditors from that time I suppose... (I am actually a 2-year redditor) 
&gt; Honestly, I have a hard time believing that, but if it's true, then either a) you're irrational, or b) you value even negative experience more than you fear pain/death.  The correct answer is B. I don't really see it as irrational though ... I would rather experience anything than nothing. I feel that the ability to experience is what separates us from a rock floating in space.  And anyway, when I'm dead, it won't really matter to me if I've suffered 100 years of agony, or 100 years of sheer bliss.
I am sad to say this, but I was highly addicted to World of Warcraft at the time this happened.  It is for this reason that getting a new computer was the one thing on my mind at all times, and everything else was practically meaningless.  If this happened to me now I would be completely devastated.  I am currently married and own my own house, complete with 2 cats and 2 dogs.  I have to say that since getting over my video game addiction I have been able to become more attached to material objects, since I use them more often on a day to day basis.  Previously, I only used my computer, bed, fridge, and shower while home ;/.
&gt; Stop downloading free smilies and using autorun and you will be ok.  Yes, because it is 100% impossible for any website you visit to serve malware which takes advantage of a private vulnerability in your browser, or one of its plugins, in order to make your computer part of a botnet or something equally lame to shit up the Internet.  You've "never got a virus" *that you know of*. Considering that you think the only way to get one is by intentionally downloading and running cutesy executable files, you aren't in a position to know if you had one.  Note that I'm not making the argument that anti-virus software is perfect, or that some anti-virus applications themselves can't introduce additional risks. I'm simply shooting down your theory that "common sense" alone is sufficient to keep you protected.
I dunno, you're kind of saying that a BMW and a Chevy are the same because they both have a 6 cylinder combustion engine.  There's more to a "computer" than just CPU and GPU.  It's not quite the same as Apple buying chips from Intel to put into their MBPs and iMacs.  Apple licensed some architecture from ARM, but they did manufacture and put together their own chips.  If you think it's so easy to merge a CPU, GPU, controllers and pipes onto a single piece of silicon, then you've got another think coming.
Ah, but if I own a piece of property, what authority do you have to make me follow your rules?  If you have said authority, then I do not own the land--you do.  As in my other comment, you're still resting on the assumption that society or the State or the community has a prior claim to all the land, property, and individuals in a given geographic area.  (Feel free to merge this conversation.)

Neither "Paris" nor "Menelaus" rhymes with "Wham". Priam was at the king of the city that was holding Hellen, so I took some license in writing a stupid one liner.

No, it's the **projection of the force on the direction of the motion**. Not projection on the rope direction!   You can connect the force to the object in whatever way you want, with ropes running at any angle you like. As long as the direction of the force and the direction of the motion remain the same, the force component in that direction is the same!    Using your logic, the force felt by the sleds will depend on the angle of the rope. Do you see the problem?  
As a matter of fact, I am -- when I can be bothered to attend.

Patently [false](http://www.canada.com/business/Hortons+move+signals+Canada+gaining+appeal/1744591/story.html?id=1744591).  &gt;In Canada, the federal corporate tax rate is headed to 15% in 2012, and the federal Conservative government has called on the provinces to get to a 10% business levy by the same timeframe – for a combined 25% rate on corporate income. Alberta is already at 10%, British Columbia will be there in 2011, Ontario by 2013, and New Brunswick will go down further, to 8%, in 2012.  &gt;In the United States, the top corporate tax rate is in the mid-30% range. As a result, the U.S. now has about the highest combined corporate tax rate, second only to Japan among industrialized countries.

[Have a watch.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nnVQ2fROOg) It's pretty concise.  Consider the facts of the video, that cold hard evidence was spun around as counter-hypothesis by the skeptic's attack machine, other facts ignored, and gross willful misinterpretation was rampant. Consider the fact that the CRU was *hacked* illegally to obtain these emails. Is it any wonder they deleted their emails? Sure, they could have deleted them because there was suspicious information. But consider the possibility enunciated in the video, that they did nothing fraudulent but were implicated anyway. Isn't it sensible to delete the email and remove the ammunition from the other side in the first place? The loss of credibility for the 'suspicious' act of deleting emails (and there was loss) is probably worth saving the loss of credibility for a bunch more "Tricks" and other terms for Rush Limbaugh to fuck up.
&gt; fuck themselves up no matter the legality of something  More people will do it if it's legalized. That's a fact. The reason why it didn't work for Prohibition is because alcohol is an integral part of culture nearly anywhere in the world. If it weren't, and had about the same reputation as Heroin or Cocaine, it would be easier to make illegal and regulate.  Making heroin illegal doesn't force the users into unregulated underworld black-market hell, because to be a user you must have already done so. It forces people to understand that there are real consequences if you decide to become a user in the first place, plain and simple.
Isn't it time we *desserted* such disbelief?

Im gonna tell you the story, and it will seem like total bullshit, but suspend your disbelief for 5 seconds.  The story I'm about to tell is true:   So we're sitting there discussing this naming conundrum, when all of a sudden... 5 Pirates come walking down the street. Out of no where. I bullshit you not.  It was divinely bizarre, like a message from a higher power... what that message may be is open for discussion... but it was far too perfect to be coincidence.    EDIT: I'm a little fuzzy on what we were actually talking about at the time, so I added the naming part for dramatic effect.  The picture we took of them is actually the SECOND time they crossed our path... when we were outside chopping it up with the Greenpeace folks.
When I was 17, I bought a corduroy jacket at a thrift store that had inside pockets.  INSIDE POCKETS TO ACT AS HOLSTERS FOR MY MANY NERF GUNS.  These nerf guns were later replaced by wallet, keys, phone, etc.  As my jacket is hanging on my bedpost, I have nothing in my pockets right now.
My God, I do believe I did.

I bought a 94 Lumina sedan 3 years ago. When I got it, I put new brakes, and a new power steering hose in it, and it's been running almost perfectly ever since. Almost at 200k miles on it.
Lol you're doing it wrong.
What kind of scientific evidence can I use to prove it? What scientific evidence do you have to refute it? If there is no scientific evidence for my side, does that make it real by default?
That sucks :/. What happened that you guys didn't talk anymore?
I'm suddenly turned on.
The Grammys were entertaining as hell this year though. The Michael Jackson song/collaboration was moving.
Bag No, blind fold yes.
One other part, is when you pay them you sign something saying they own you if you skip bail, thus unlike cops who need a warrant, a bounty hunter can go through your stuff and break into your house if you skipped bail, you invited him in. The only place you are somewhat safe is in another country since the bounty hunters don't have their special status outside of the country (though they might try).
agreed.  It can be damn dear impossible to lever them up and over.  You can use soapy water as a lubricant to make the bead slide up on the rim easier, but that can also make the lever itself more slippery.  
Yeah because I'm 7 and those mean bullies are going to catch me for having a laptop :(   Oh wait. I'm not at school anymore! SWEET!
Although you are right, it's worth pointing out that being Christian or Muslim is something anyone can in theory embrace and adopt...Jews are by nature exclusionary. For the most part you gotta be born into it.
Shiver me timbers! An extra tot of rum for thee!
Wrong.   On the census they are listed as: Black, African American, Negro. They are clearly defined. Native American or Alaskan Native. As are Asians: Asian Indian, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, etc...  There's only whites
Meh, you're just jealous.

So you're saying that donating money sent to CCP by customers (aka income) which would otherwise become profit is somehow being tricky?
that may be well and good, but i don't see his name mentioned in that article.
Haha weirdo.
Why would he make fun of him? Conan loves this kind of stuff. Remember the sculpture of him somebody made out of white chocolate and bacon? He went and kept it on display outside his studio for days.
wouldn't that be "undeaddit"?
True that. After finishing the campaigns with random people, I usually go back only when there is people playing that I know.
I like that bit about the gorilla and sign language. 
The way I see it, she had problems when I met her. If she were to kill herself I know it would not be my fault.
well thats OK. like everything it takes practice and a few ;) winky faces can go a long way.  you shouldn't have pushed a fight about it. why not just be supportive and say something along the lines of "my throbbing hard cock thinks you're doing fine" and just leave it at that. Sexting is just for FUN. if she feels intimidated by your natural sexting prowess you should be more patient and accept her limits.

I was skeptical of Silverlight at first, but my roomie's been bugging me for help with a Silverlight project for his job, and I gotta say, I'm impressed. It's like all the shit I wish GDI+ were capable of, in a browser. When it's not confusing as shit, it's pretty damn neat.

Setting aside 1913, JFK, MLK, RFK and the Reagan 2T that was to be paid off thru the "piece dividend" that went DOA.  I place our current calamity on the lack of "change" after the ringing of the 78-79 oil crisis bell. "We the people" have already achieved the future, Technology either brings forth freedom today or Corp/Govt usury serf Tyranny tomorrow. Nothing proposed by Corp/Govt expands the Freedom &amp; Liberty of "We", it only contracts privileges, while thru the Idiocracy of bureaucracies "they" profit.  Edit: deficit spending goes back really really far into history.
That sloppiness was a lot more than seconds by the time JFK got to her.
The way you put a dog to sleep would actually be a great way to go.  Painless, surrounded by family, quick.
Haha, I wouldn't even know where to begin. I probably started early 2001, so that is about 9 years of continuously play. That's roughly 78,000 hours if I played all 24 hours without a break. At first I played 5-10 hours a day (because was a teenager with lots of free time), but as I went to college and got a job, I played less and less. My usual playing time is anywhere from 40 minutes to 2 hours a couple of times a week.  So, I would estimate it as no less than 5,000 hours and no more than 15,000 hours.

Crysis features a [powered exo-skelecton](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPYF1IftGBc).  You get super human abilities through nanite injections: super speed and super strength.  The suit also has the ability to repair itself and bend light around it turning the soldier invisible.  Powers limited but it recharges over time. 
I'd love to know how some of the commands you used

Somehow, I don't think you're coming into this with an open mind.  Are you actually willing to consider arguments or are you here merely to trash libertarianism by claiming that since there's no existing example of a libertarian society today, therefore it's a failed concept?

I make them out of cool pictures/images I find online. If you go on amazon sticker paper is really cheap, I paid £20 for a 100 sheets. Just PDF/photoshop the images you want into the paper, print, cut it out and hey presto!  Also, I buy useless shit that noramlly has stickers. But yeah most of those are self made. If you want any of the image files of stickers I used, tell me and I'll upload them for you ^^

Property rights only exist within a social contract that protects them. Outside of a social contract you only have a right to that which you can protect.  You cannot make a moral claim to property as you cannot historically validate such a claim. Therefore you have to rely upon social structures to both lay a claim and enforce them.   This is a property debate.  Sneaking in *individuals* does not make your point any stronger,it just shows your debating in bad faith.  I have stated repeatedly the individual is under no obligation to stay within the geographic area.

To be fair, that *is* why I mentioned it. If I could dig up his bibliography I would, but sadly the four-volume set is beyond the means of my college-student budget to handle.  It was quashed by the redcoats when the next king, who favored Penn slightly less than a man favors having his testicles crushed, came to power. It was also under constant assault from Penn himself, since he was rather eager for taxes to be collected and deposited into his accounts.  Calling it a paradise, even in sarcasm, would be a mistake; anarcho-capitalism has its own problems. They are different from those suffered under a State, but they do exist. I do figure that it's better to live with those than to endlessly ponder my serfdom in the current system.
that either of you care if people care if you care about karma is enough to make me want to bang your heads together!      forget about it, if someone says you love karma then does it matter? when is it going to come up in a job interview?      "I see here that pinkerton253 said you pay too much attention to karma on reddit?"      "no, it's just coincidence that people vote my comments...."

If there was a problem with it they would change the rules on single women.  I'm not here to argue their policies for them, just to tell you about them.  
True, but that would only work if your life insurance policy holder was the same as your health insurance policy holder, which seems like a bad idea (If you have a terminal illness that will cost $1 million/year, and your life insurance policy is only $500 000, the company would have incentive to find a way to withhold medical care - it could even be said that they have a responsibility to their shareholders, but that's another debate entirely)   It seems to me like a likely outcome will be that life insurance companies represent themselves as "taking the moral high ground" and refuse to pay out in instances of suicide, whether medical euthanasia or otherwise. 
Well, yeah I guess I know it's true. I am more wondering why that is. I think it might be a construct..like a learned emotion. ....[8] btw, and I know I sound like it.

Hyperbolically fair. A more reasonable over generalization is that unforseen consequences confound regulations. There exist quotas meant to help the handicapped, women, racial minorities, and other groups in the work place. Such regulations increase the risk of hiring people that fall into these groups; these people are held to higher standards; these regulations hurt those intended to benefit.  France has odd pracices that make it hard to fire someone [citation needed], intended to help the little guy keep jobs. Instead, it increases the risk of hiring someone, giving advantage to connected folk and hurting minorities. This increases tension between French and the influx of Muslim immigrants. I believe these immigrants released some of this tension years ago by torching cars.  Unintended consequences follow any action; hope in government solutions should account for this. Unlike free market solutions, governments don't allow for competing alternatives.
Yes.  Cheating on your wife, exposing her to possible STDs, etc, etc.
Yeah, I know I just thought it was odd that he left that out. Because honestly it is a pretty big factor (at least in my opinion and the opinion of those around me).

Seconded. Also, if you're interested in the Zen path, [Three Pillars of Zen](http://www.amazon.com/Three-Pillars-Zen-Teaching-Enlightenment/dp/0385260938) or [Eight Gates of Zen](http://www.amazon.com/Eight-Gates-Zen-Spiritual-Monastery/dp/1882795008). The latter was written by the abbot of the Zen Mountain Monastery (John Daido Loori, who just past away a few months ago) in new Woodstock NY.

I doubt this means very little to you, but:  "small businesses" mean a lot to the oregon economy and we need every job we can get, especially during times like this. And if you had read absolutely anything, it would have become apparent that they are taxing revenue (i.e. total income *before* deductions).   Please take the time to inform yourself on matters like this before flying off the handle about how "utter CRAP" something is, or even worse, voting in our state.   
So, what do you need to get started?  Besides the DVD's and a pull-up bar, do you need any other equipment?  I don't really want to do the supplements so many other people on P90X seem to do, because I'm on a budget.  What do you think?

"Come to Daddy" is such a mindfuck for me. 
That was my first thought as well. I remember hearing about a case in which someone was in this situation, their mind decaying, and asked the courts for permission to let him "die" early so he could be suspended with as much of his brain information intact as possible. They didn't allow it.  I'm hoping this thing can be combined with the cryo issue. (dammit T.P., why couldn't you try to save yourself too though... :(

I don't know why but I couldn't stop watching that for a few minutes. It feels like on one of those loops the dick will actually touch his face.
I tried a lot of different ideas, flashbacks, jump cuts, the idea that I most liked was to do the whole movie as a faux-documentary about a separate documentary about Johnny that relieved the documentary footage of the original storyline, sort of a documentary about an unfinished documentary.... but it all got so complex that I lost interest.   I think the only person that could successfully adapt this book is Charlie Kaufman, and he's lightyears ahead of me.
I'd love to share a beer and / or bong with him.
I think the whole speech is excellent and explains it very well. Free speech is easy if everyone already gets along and agrees. That is not how the world works though, if you want free speech, real free speech then you have to be willing to allow speech that makes you angry. If burning a flag gets you pissed off then it shows that it is an effective form of protest. Protests are supposed to stir emotions, get people angry. Whether or not it helps their cause is another story.   
GUYS I REMEMBER THAT MOVIE!!
&gt;Poor white kids, especially poor white males, have turned to the right because they feel they have **been excluded by the left**  I can't for the life of me figure out why!  &gt;That would grow a core of progressives in the **redneck** community, a core that would grow as the years passed.  ...Oh... people like you.

Fruit=fruity. Get your man to mango it up. Pineapple is good too.
He really, really is. And wonderfully well-tempered. I thought he had separation anxiety, because he kicked up quite the fuss when I shut him up for the night (he's otherwise silent), but last night in about ten minutes I taught him "Bean, quiet", and tonight I only had to shush him once, right after I shut him in his little room. It's shocking, especially considering he's an Iggy, they're usually more independent. If I were able to keep a dog right now, I probably would. But he'll make anyone a fantastic pet, so I'm just happy I get to love him for now.

Ha. It's pretty obvious when it is and isn't an own goal. The ball, as it left Nani's foot, wasn't going to go into the net. Watch the replay. It clearly would've gone clear across the face of goal (at best, it would've clipped the post). Of course, Park happened to be right about where it would've landed, and probably would have been able to quite simply redirect it past Almunia.  The point is, though, the ball wasn't going to go in without a redirection from someone. It was not on target. As Almunia was the one who redirected it into the net, it's an own goal. It's pretty obvious from the replay.  That doesn't mean Nani doesn't deserve full credit for the setup, though. That was some really brilliant work from him to get it into that position, especially the way he shedded two defenders in the blink of an eye.

Honestly, jump the gun on this one.  The Windows install is tried and true ,so, if you have to go back, it's not that bad.  Skip the experimental stuff.

Maybe that's why you spay and neuter pets, but I do it for the sake of the animals in shelters.

Hmm - I didn't really get that at all from the recording.  It seemed genuine to me.  Are you sure you weren't disturbed by it and calling it fake might be a way of denying the gravity or reality of the situation?  I mean, if real, it's profoundly unnerving to listen to the final minutes of someone's life, especially the end.  I think that's why I've written as much on this page as I have - this was a real man, with a family, a life, and a promising future, and you have just listened to his last words - his final contribution.  I didn't think it was right that everyone jumped on the "Neutral. Idiot" bandwagon without further investigating the circumstances.

This is a thing [trend?] that seems to have just bent right around my existence.  Growing up and all the way through college, the hipster around me did not like science fiction at all.  They would sometimes be interested in certain movies or shows, particularly if they had 'so bad it's good' value, but none would ever be caught dead reading sci-fi blogs.  I keep being told that hipsters are into sci fi now, I just never see it. Perhaps that's why I'm so put off by io9.
I worked help desk at a large university that had this same policy. It was the bane of our existence. First someone calls and is pissed off because their password isn't working (it's never that they forgot it, someone it's always that the system messed up). Then we get a nice earful after they realize that they can't use the same password again (yes, this same person that insisted they were typing their password correctly before, now actually *is* typing it correctly when they try to re-use as their new password. Oh the irony).  The only argument for this policy I can see is a case where someone gains access to an account and uses it in such a manner that the owner of the account doesn't notice someone else is using it. After (at most) 3 months, the intruder no longer has access. However, I fail to see how this case justifies forcing 80,000 people to change their password every 3 months.
Yes, but then it stops being football and starts being Transformers.

Here's a link that's from a Powerpoint presentation, so it [looks kind of bad](http://74.125.95.132/search?q=cache:jyM7AN5exFEJ:cstl-csm.semo.edu/scheibe/CompAnat2008/Circulation.ppt+evolution+of+circulatory+system&amp;cd=3&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=us) but it's got a lot of good stuff.  What I find most fascinating about circulatory systems is how every part of the body is geared up to create its own envasculation and hook up to the main system. But it's not a miracle, it's because of the way DNA works by having chemical gradients switch things on and off.  Also, the lymphatic system is pretty weird, since it only takes things away so it only needs to have one way valves and then it works off of contractions of surrounding muscles.

I disagree. How does burning a flag make *any* point? I really don't give a shit what you're protesting at that juncture and I have already concluded that you are a silly twit just trying to get some attention.  I think it's counter productive.  Like I said, I don't think it should really be any kind of *felony*, but I think you've just completely shat on the rights that are afforded you under the very flag that you are burning. At that point, you're just a dickhead.
I have to disagree with that, if you provide clean, quality drugs, then others mistakes are not your fault. 100% pure heroine or meth is way safer than a 'softer' drug cut with some shit. Knowledge is power.

I can't speak for Unix, but on Windows a shared library (DLL) takes effectively no time to load if it is already in use by another running program, whereas statically linked libraries are always loaded because they're part of the executable's binary.  Thus there's only one copy of the DLL version of the C run-time library in memory at any time.  So in that case, dynamic linking (like Dr. Who) saves both time and space.

&gt;Would any attorney be willing to suggest a client skips bail?  It is an ethics violation. However perhaps in this case the attorney's thought process was something like:  * I am morally opposed to long prison sentences for non-violent offenders.  * My client is facing significant prison time.  * My client is from a foreign, non-extradition state.  * My client seems like a nice guy.  * Perhaps I'll just mention what would happen *hypothetically* if he left and never came back.  Edit: Looking at some of runawayy's other comments it appear his attorney's conduct was also illegal.

It's not friction, your reference is still old. For example steel wire penetrates ice block a way faster, then the cotton fiber of the same diameter.

Arsenal fan here... :)  &gt;In Gallas' defense he was really their only threat once they pushed forward.  That would be all well and good... if he weren't a defensemen. He has a pretty specific job. He can help orchestrate an Arsenal attack... but not at the expense of letting United attackers fly past him on a counter.  The defense was rubbish today. If Arsenal has to rely on their defense to both score and defend, that's bad news. Improve the attack and let the defenders do what they're paid to do (which they haven't been that great at all season).  No denying Man Utd deserved this win. Arsenal was out-coached and out-played.
just another cheeto that wasn't accounted for...

Whoa now. I never said they weren't necessary. Don't start with the straw men because I can spot them from a mile away.  &gt;But in America the citizens pay taxes on their income. End of story.  I'm not disagreeing with this point (another straw man). All I was doing was successfully shooting holes in your logic of "just because they're able to pay more means they should" by using a relatively perfect analogy. You have more kidneys than a person with two failing kidneys, therefore, you should give them one. This is why utilitarianism can be a dangerous philosophy to subscribe to.

&gt;First of all, the Swiss knew FULL WELL this crap was going on. They put their heads in the sand for decades to hope they wouldn't get caught.  Swiss bank secrecy predates American bank secrecy law.   &gt;On the other hand, this is an AMERICAN problem that should have never had the chance to happen. It should have been address by AMERICAN law and enforced. Both being major failures of our Congress and President.  The major failures of the government are they deficit spent so much that a possible one time tax revenue of around $50 billion is worth violating the laws of another country. Not that the US government has a track record of respecting the rights of other governments.  &gt;Then of course, there are the scumbugs that are hiding from their due taxes.  The US government has a voluntary tax system, which means the taxpayers determine the correct amount of taxes based on how their finances are arranged.

I was being facetious; the main purpose of Birthright is to let American Jews see Israel for themselves.  My point was that the people who go on Birthright are normal 18-25 year olds, just like any Jews you might have known in high school.  There's nothing religious about the IDF's operations; like them or not, they're motivated by defense of the state.

Something similar happened to me, but it was a Shell station in El Segundo at like 4am. I was several hundred miles away before I knew it was gone, and wasn't sure where I had lost it. A week or so later, the LAPD contacts me and sends back the physical wallet with ALL my ID cards, credit cards, photos etc and a check for the $67 cash that was enclosed when an honest citizen turned it in.  Not a penny was stolen. I am so grateful to my anonymous do-gooder!  Oh, I later found out there is a song called I Lost My Wallet (In El Segundo) so that was a little weird.

Crap foods, like soda, crisps, pastries, and candy have the highest markup of any prepared foods. Nearly all of the foods that we associate with a poor diet are actually processed  versions of the cheapest foods available. Not cheap because of subsidization, but cheap because they're easy to grow, provide high yields per acre, and are easy to ship and store. They're actually quite over priced  when you factor the cost of  the raw products they're made from.

Also watch out for static postures that unduly emphasize isometric strength, even one as easy as [chair](http://www.yogajournal.com/poses/493).

That said, some strenuous postures might still be worth doing. If you overdid it on your abs, [bridges](http://www.yogajournal.com/poses/473) might be just the thing.

&gt;Not true. The pressures required to melt ice are immense.   Not at all. Hang a small weight from a loop of wire, then dangle the weight from an icecube. The wire melts the ice below it due to the pressure, then sinks, and the water immediately re-freezes above the wire. The weighted loop will eventually pass right through the ice, leaving the icecube completely intact.

I saw an edited version played on late night network TV when I was around 7-10 and it scared the crap outta me.
What I mean is that he didn't factor in anything outside of the content within the Bible to argue the existence of the Christian god. He never considered the history behind the origins of Christianity, nor the history relevant to the *evolution* (no pun intended) and development of Christianity to what it is today.  In fact, what's really sad is that he never really read much of the Bible except what was spoon-fed to him during those few times he actually attended church. But he would defend his belief of this god to the bitter end.  EDIT: religion does weird shit to people.
The worst part about reading reddit is seeing comments like this, and knowing that more likely than not, (s)he's not kidding.  (ED: not to the poster, to the fact that 'neo-nazis' still exist and believe they have a purpose in this world)
I think I saw a larger version and it said something along the lines of "the delicious taste of kraft dinner macaroni &amp; cheese"

Well, it is a direct quote.
Sorry dude, yours is a high school mistake. Look into it, and I'm sure you'll figure it out.    Here's food for thought: what if you had two ropes instead of one, with different angles, which one would you choose to calculate the force?    What if you had three V-shaped ropes like you drew instead of one? What if you were pulling on a solid triangular brace attached to the sleds, which angle would you choose then?  I'm not gonna argue with you, but if you care about it, ask a Physics prof or someone else with a firm grip on mechanics. They may be able to explain it better than me typing on a keyboard a thousand miles away.
Well I meant in a good natured way. I'm sure he would appreciate the hard work that went into it but come on, Cheeto Conan is a comedic goldmine.

The deficit spending of the Reagan era was always intended to enrich corporations at the people's expense.  It continued through the first Bush administration, and was trimmed back (not enough, but some) during the Clinton years.  Then Bush Jr. took it and went nuts, bringing us to the point where we are today.  Do you know what economists attribute most to the golden years when we were the most prosperous and productive?  FDR's deficit spending on infrastructure.  If we can do that now, we'll not only pay off the deficit of forty years, we'll enter a new golden age.  But not if people like you keep being concern trolls about spending money to fix the problem, which is a far cry from spending money just to enrich your corporate sponsors.

The rope is what is being pulled directly by the TC, so the force experience on the muscles is proportional to the tension in the rope.  The work done per second (power!) is the same no matter what (conservation of energy).

Most password storage mechanisms include the salt with the hash.  The main purpose of the salt is to make things like [rainbow tables](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainbow_table) not worthwhile.  As an example, consider the following line from a Unix shadow file:      test:$6$KHFOara/$VL9eeh9rBJPBJXL32M9Mf9587u67HXdSBBIxKXkmxFtoCqsouZVJl7M1jeZVJi4kNFKGEABdd31dlr8Z/aAC..:14641:0:99999:7:::   Here, the string between the 2nd and 3rd $ (KHFOara/) is the salt, the number between the first pair of $ indicates the hash function being used, and everything between the third $ and the : is the password hash.  I actually don't know what hash function the number 6 indicates, I was somewhat surprised that my system isn't using MD5.  It's probably SHA-512 or something.

This will be an adaptation of the manga on which everything else is based, not a live action adaptation of the movies or the anime series. With a large special effects budget and good actors, which I think Spielberg can probably get, it has a chance of being a really good movie.

It's a silly argument, but from what I saw this was Almunia's goal. As an Arsenal supporter, that is *not* a good thing. I'd prefer if it were just a legitimate straightforward Nani goal because it only helps to show how inept Alumnia has become lately.  I'm not trying to argue that takes credit away from Nani's work to set it up. He was brilliant.

Actually, the touchscreen of the iPhone works in a thin plastic bag. As for the gloves, I believe that there is a video around the interwebs on how to make touchscreen compataple gloves with a little bit of wire.   I agree with your stylus support idea. I believe that the pogo stylus already supports the trackpad on the unibody Macbooks, and it shouldn't be that hard to get support for the iPad either. The results could be fantastic. That why I will wait untill 2nd gen to buy one. Once people and accessory companies discover more uses for it, the iPad will truley become the "magical" product Steve Jobs said it was. But my mockup only shows the things APPLE must do to make this product work.

Milk from Holsteins (90% of dairy production in the US) comes out at about 3.5% from the cow. So whole milk is about 3.5% fat, then there's 2%, 1%, and skim milk.   Yes, I'm a little milk obsessed. But I do remember the creamery would pay a premium for milk with higher fat, so we would adjust the cows' feed to get higher fat in our milk.
After a little more research, I'm realizing there may not be any values of *x* satisfying that equation.  For example, it looks like there are two values of *x* that satisfy x = 1.4^x, but none that satisfy x = 1.5^x.  You can see this by graphing the functions x, 1.4^x, and 1.5^x together and seeing where they intersect.  [Like this.](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=plot+{1.4^x,x}+x%3D0..5)  Edit: Thanks to [unkz's comments](http://www.reddit.com/r/learnmath/comments/awh7l/solving_for_a_function_with_variable_as_both/c0jrbmg) it's actually possible to find the point solutions appear: if b &gt; e^(a/e).

I think you can argue that those who choose the earlier material over the later material are making a less rational choice than those who consider the later material as superseding the earlier.  So when Jesus says "Moses taught this, but now I teach that...", he's explicitly issuing updates that are supposed to take precedence.  But mostly, I think it's that a great many people consider their religion a kind of club, and they look down on anybody outside the club.  So they find a passage about stoning gay people, but they ignore the part about "let he who is without sin cast the first stone".  People like Mr Rogers considered his religion as teaching that there's only one club, with 6+billion members.  There was nobody on the outside for him to look down on.

That is the feature I am almost finished implementing now and then will design the user interface for. I wanted to get feedback on the current state in the meantime. Here are my plans for custom messages (comment if you wish!):  I imagine turning the Manage Exclusions page into a Manage Friends page where you can "Exclude" or "Set a Personal Message". I am building a lightweight templated language so people can specify generic defaults &amp; totally personal ones, for example: "Happy Birthday &lt;first_name&gt;" to everyone and then still set custom messages to individuals, "Hey Mike. Hope you have a great birthday. Let's grab a beer and get Patrick Swastey!" (you get the idea...).  Thanks BlazedAndConfused.

I'm not sure if socialism and corporatism are mutually exclusive, but then corporatism and socialism are both very general terms.  Anyways, socialism refers to public or direct worker ownership of a societies means of production.  I would say government ("public") regulation of infrastructure (internet connectivity in this case) could pretty easily be considered socialism or a step towards socialism.

Well bad breath can be caused by a number of things, including food particles.  Or your teeth rotting out of your head.  I'm just saying, without a regular cleaning of maybe the labial folds or... *something*... it's basically a hole in your body that only sheds whatever is in it once a month.  So it just kind of sits there with crap fermenting in it to produce foul odors. If I put a bandaid on my finger for a month it's gonna smell horrible, I don't understand how that doesn't apply everywhere else on the body. (gay male here so I'm just hypothesizing. I don't think I will ever know what a vagina smells like).

I took the leap, to see if it was really faster, and it is. A month later, Chrome Beta came out, so now Chrome supports extensions, including ad blockers, leaving very little reason for me to go back.

I assure you there was no 'high-school mistake' although i agree my picture was rather roughly constructed.  The key thing is that the force you are exerting on the rope (tension) is not in the same direction as the motion of the sled (direction of resistance), which requires a higher force to be exerted to overcome the friction.  Note that the work done per second, or power, will be the same no matter what, assuming velocity-independent friction.

Prayer is a big thing for some people - they think that their god listens and acts directly to their words. I see it as a symptom of religiousness in general, though some religious people pray more fervently than others.  If you want to know in general why people pray, your research into psychology is as reasonable an explanation as any for irrational behavior; if you want to know personal reasons why a given individual prays despite lack of evidence you would do better to ask them. I'm not sure you'll find much more in the atheism subreddit than "because they're dumb," "they're misled" etc. If you just want confirmation that they are irrational, you have come to the right place - atheism isn't about wondering why religious people do stupid things, it's about not being religious

That is true to some degree; however the iPhone massively changed the whole mobile phone market in a way that no other device managed to do. After that massive change, others had to compete with Apple and what followed made Apple not rest on their laurels.   The crux of my point is that had the iPhone never existed, mobile phones would have been mired in the lack of true innovation. We now enjoy across many mobile offerings from a range of companies.
I disagree, your definition is too narrow and you are considering only one manifestation of passive aggressive behavior.  They certainly didn't use assertive behavior, and they didn't confront the person directly with their aggressive message.  Even if we consider the contextually inappropriate definition you provide, exactly how doesn't this fit passive resistance in an interpersonal situation?  passive - they left a note resistance - it was a nasty note and they left the person's clothes in the trash can  You're making the mistake of confusing the clinical diagnosis criteria of the DSM with the much more pedestrian definition that is commonly used:  http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/passive%20aggressive

I highly doubt he thinks that all people will make the right choices, but making it illegal doesn't guarantee that either.  Your friends, for example, got addicted and ruined their lives anyway.  We have a **very** long history of drug abuse that shows, quite clearly, that prohibition doesn't effectively prevent addiction.  Education isn't a solve-all, but clearly prohibition isn't either.  It has the side effect of also ruining the lives of people who **do** have self control, and use responsibly but get caught.

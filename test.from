You can look it up in history books but in the first part of the Korean war America was about to go home defeated, they were unprepared, unfit and had ineffective weapons, among them anti-thank weapons that were not functioning. The boys back there were battered and   scared shitless. That is not coming from sinophiles, that comes from American history books and MacArthur himself. Now you misunderstood what i said, America was about to be defeated by the North Koreans who were very well armed and very motivated and used to fighting in the extreme cold and shitty condition.

I don't really see the point of building a system (albeit configuring WP plugins) to notify families of their balance.  Why not set up WP to accept payments; better yet, create a paypal account for them.  Then they can email the balance values to their users.  The people will most likely have email addresses.  No sense in complicating the process.  Unless there's more you didn't tell us.  **Edit**: If you insist I would suggest using [WP Sentry](http://www.peteholiday.com/wp-sentry/)  WP Sentry allows you as the WP admin to create groups of users and allow or deny access to posts to certain groups.  You could, in theory, create a group for each "family" and only allow that "family"/group access to their post.  You could put their balance on that post.  Given then information you provided, that's what I would do.
Damn the post sorta got my blood pumping
Not really anything wrong with that! People often find things humourus in real life.

Without measurement, without time, of course, there would be no physics...'existence' [as practiced on Earth.] Well, that is problematic. Let's see. If I should move from one room to another, in 'time' I cease to exist in the present in the room I 'was' in, nevertheless, I remain measurable, and as a 'probability' will remain so, that is the essence of physics, all of science, actually. Yet, I will never, ever again, be in that 'past' room again, due to the 1.6 km/hr speed of our universe as conjectured today, (hope I got that right from). So measurement, and 't' also must conform to the 'probability', again, of repeating a state. Thus, physical existence can seem to be quite nebulous, when you think about it.  
I have no hope that the Republicans will ever be reasonable. I see no point in even talking to them.

What did you expect?  You watch a video, see a picture, or read an article and all your pains go away?  Its going to take time, and a positive mental outlook.  Saying things like, "but does nothing to alleviate the pain" is melodrama and negative thinking.    Yes, this video CAN do something to alleviate the pain, your perspective it just skewed at the moment cause you are just a little down in the dumps.  Activities, staying busy, these are constructive.
&gt; We had AANR certification so open sex and erections were not allowed.   Referring to the erections... how is this supposed to be enforced?  I guess for a seasoned veteran it would not be hard to suppress it in public, but for a nudist newbie how are they supposed to ignore natural urges.  Like, sometimes I don't get a hard-on by choice that won't exactly go quietly into the night right away.

I lived in the south, and found it to be vastly similar, just hotter and with drawls. I was kinda amazed at how much hype there was to things southern vs the actual differences.   &gt;but what is so ignorant about wanting to learn about cultural norms  Asking about the norms and culture of Nashville would be one thing, but the south isn't some unified block of culture like it's 1865. Louisana is gonna be different from Atlanta which is different from Wilmington NC which is different from West Virginia, etc....   &gt;The fact there is an NHL team is not some unifying cultural force for me, man.  I question how much of a total southern backwater any place with an NHL team could be. It seems to me most metropolitan areas are gonna be similar to one another.

The DHD has built-in protocols to prevent a wormhole intersecting a solar flare, thus the jury-rigged DHD allowing that problem to happen.  The 38 time limit could be an artefact of the physics involved.  That they don't know how to force shutdown doesn't mean the system doesn't support it, they just haven't figured that out yet.  The part about it exploding probably relates to the Lantian anti-wraith weapon.  The gates in Pegasus are a newer design than the Milky Way ones.  This could be a bug specific to their design, that was never fixed due to the war.  So there:P
Well done!

That sounds actually perfect. He told me last night that the day we when we hung out, things weren't really serious between them. We hung out 5 days before they announced their engagement. He's freaking out at me cause he's terrified I'm going to tell her, but now I really have no way of telling her. I don't know the girl, but I know Scott, and he's a cheater, he's a liar, and he's always number one on his list. I hope that she doesn't get her heart broken. 
It's been experimentally verified.  It is not a theory.

You said:  &gt; The Chinese fought back when MacArthur's troops were closing in on the Chinese borders [...] MacArthur wanted to pick a fight with China because he thought America could handle it.  So you weren't referring to the early stages of the war when you said that MacArthur was picking a fight with China.  At that point, the US had shit well in hand their "defeat" was far from "assured".

A lot of people talk about being scared. My movie wasn't scary at all, but more psychological (not psychological scary either!).  This movie disturbed me because it was purely psychological was called eXistenZ. It just bothered me thinking about actual existence; had me thinking philosophically for weeks.
The behavior wasn't defined before and the behavior also wasn't defined after the release.  The documentation is bad because it only tells you what's usually returned, but it doesn't tell you about the things that function might return.  You see, users are reading the documentation because they want to know these things. Even more so if error handling is very inconsistent as it is with PHP.  For example `strpos` returns a `boolean FALSE` if "needle" wasn't found. The documentation tells you this important detail. It might for example also return -1 or `NULL` instead.  Good documentation tells you everything you need to know.

Several years ago, I was driving down a highway at about 70 mph.  It was a state road, not an Interstate.  Some people apparently decided they wanted to cross the road and didn't want to wait for cars to pass.  They were crossing to the median.  Now, I was watching them and letting off my gas, because I didn't trust them to *stop* at the median.  Most of them did except for a small child, perhaps age 5-6, who jumped out into the road right in front of me.  I swerved right, left, right; didn't hit the kid, stayed within the bounds of the lane just to my right, and ended up right back in the lane that I'd started from.  I don't consider myself to be some kind of superman.  It just takes some knowledge of how to control your car and the presence of mind to be observant of the behaviors of others around you.

There is the horror movie where I think the kids were digging a hole or something in the backyard and it leads to hell or something.  Anyway this big ugly monster comes out of the hole after a series of other crazy monsters have come out and the kid kills it with his model rocket...  That movie scared me for years.

&gt;it's not Apple limiting what sites you can visit. it's flash based websites doing the limiting.  Slightly true (do to your obfuscating). The artificial disabling of flash limits you. That is all there is to it. You can say that there are problems with flash but making it not work is to keep people buying apps and that is it.   You sound like you are a developer. I don't get why you don't even try to comment on flash not being allowed on Apples mobile platform. That's the conversation we are actually having.   &gt;flash is nice, but it's a memory/cpu hog, and the cause of many a user pains, crashes being just the tip of the iceberg.  Maybe you should switch to PC's. Just about every PC made in the last 5 years can handle flash without a problem.

I assume the 360 version is similar enough to the pc version. Once you hit fire, you have about 5 seconds to put your crosshairs on your target before the missiles hit. The missiles aren't actually shooting out of the UAV chopper, they're coming in from somewhere else, which is why there is a delay between hitting fire and hitting the target.

We would tell a manager if it seemed to be a problem.  erections weren't allowed so most people would just cover them up if they got one on accident.  I would never report someone if I thought it was an accident, but if they were being pervy we could get them kicked out.    This one time there was an old old man who came into our restaurant with a huge boner, he must have had 2 or 3 blue helpers, and it was probably the only one he was getting that year.  Well, it seemed he was just trying to get away from the crowds and calm down, so I left him alone, but one of my friends got pissy about it and called the manager over who told him he had to cover it up.  The old man got really defensive and he shouted "My arm's hard do I have to cover that up too?" Hysterical.

Never saw that happen. People are usually polite but reserved, and generally don't stare, so I guess they'd ignore it. There's an automatic social formality that people stick to. Despite the fact that I was probably the first naked white guy a lot of these Korean dudes had ever seen, I never thought that I was being stared at.  In the women side, on the other hand, my foreigner friends would tell me that Korean women would be *really* friendly. One girl I knew was getting her back scrubbed down before she even knew what was happening.  Meanwhile, here in Toronto, the last time I went to work out at my local gym I noticed that they're installing separate shower stalls. It's not because I want to oggle naked people or anything that this disturbs me - it's just a subtle sign that we're becoming even more insecure with our bodies. We're letting the advertising and fashion industries win.

In my opinion, Phish and the String Cheese Incident really appeal to those who enjoy live shows, and want to be a part of the entire experience.

At first, I was completely scared. I feared Interpol, CIA agents coming for me, even my own local force (in other words, I was afraid the US would contact the police in my country and have me arrested). I was also afraid of the bondsman who bailed me out, and even felt a bit guilty about it at first (I even wanted to repay the $85,000 I still owed him). Then I got over it and live a new life.  I have a new name, I live in a house house, I have a new profession now and I am married. It would be nearly impossible to link me with my old life without extensive researches. Since these researches were never made in the 10+ years, I have no reason to believe they will be done now.
Actually, they probably did want to put you into either the nuke or CT programs, and you'd be more or less guaranteed of getting that A school. Of the multitudes of bad promises the recruiters give you, that's not one of them.

I think the same can be said for psychopathic people in general.  All of those centuries, the sexual abuse of kids by priests has been covered up, hushed under a rug because of religion.  And look at honor killings in the world.  And look at those parents who allow their children to die because they believed that getting their children medical attention would doom them to hell.  Any atrocity becomes more acceptable when the person doing it is perceived to be very pious.

CSS has the same guns and maps but it plays a lot differently.  Some key differences off the top of my head:  * More random spread patterns when going full auto.  In 1.6, bullets go above the corsshair as you spray.  In CSS, they spread out more randomly.  * Larger hit boxes.  * Slower walking speed, doesn't allow you to move as quickly without making any noise.  Basically, CSS is more random and more friendly to novice players.  Valve has been continuing this trend for a long time.  1.6 had bigger hit boxes than 1.5 and added equipment like the tactical shield.  Then there was a patch for 1.6 released in late 2003 or early 2004 that made the recoil for M4 and AK more random and added AWP scope delay.  You used to be able to quick switch with the AWP and bring up the scope immediately.  Those were the days...

Ok  you just did not understand my post at all. In the begining of the korean war America was getting it's ass handed to it, they were about to be driven into the sea, they were almost ready to pack home when the tides of war changed and began to have more success, MacArthur went on a roll and succeeded in pushing back North Korean forces back a bit. Now MacArthur was under direct order from the president to not go up the 38 if there were any sign of Chinese opposition there, which there were, MacArthur said fuck it we can take those commies and engaged them, which was a really bad move on his part because the Chinese did not get the memo about American superiority and had a very different opinion about that, so they pushed back in force and the rest is history.

COuple problems with your thinking.  Displacement is not the same as a cessation of existence.  If you move from point A to A', then you have *displaced* but not ceased to exist.  This is made plain by the fact that your body can still be measured.    Further, I believe your perspective on movement is inconsistent with relativity.  A key part of relativity is that there is no preferred reference frame.  As such, it is impossible to have any absolute speeds - only relative.  NB: I wish to remind that quantum mechanics is not applicable to humans.  It stops working on scales about that of the atom.

I went through similar moods when I went paleo. I was told to expect that though, as my body wasn't getting its sugar "fix" that I was previously getting in processed foods. It lasted about two weeks. Maybe give it another shot?  Speaking of diet, are you getting enough iron?
Thanks.  That's what I figured.  I have ridden past the dirt track everyday for about 5 years on the way to work and thought about riding it.  On Saturday I rode the track.  It's long, but relatively flat making it fast enough to ride, for fun on the way to work.  I was told by the guy I'm buying the bike from that doing that everyday will kill the bike.  But I'm not sure about that.....

As long as you're walking on a slab of plastic/rubber/whatever, you're not *really* using your feet. You'll see when you've gone barefoot for a few days straight. It hurts at first. You have to learn to walk differently.  Once you get used to being barefoot/barely-barefoot, regular shoes are a hazard. It's hard to drive because you can't feel the pedal and make little adjustments with just your toes, it's hard to walk down stairs because you can't feel the edge of the steps, and it's especially hard to run because you can't feel the ground and you can't flex the way you want to.

I think you may have seasoned it too hot. You can start from square one by putting the pan through your ovens self-clean cycle. This will leave **nothing but clean cast iron**. As soon as you can remove it from the oven wash with hot water and rub dry. Then rub the entire pan with a more high temp oil. I use peanut or Crisco. Put it back in the oven(face down) and bring it up to 350* for 1/2 hour. Shut off oven and let the pan cool down. You should be quite happy with the results.

Quite false. See one paragraph down: "But she would not tell a reporter what agency had issued the permits." There isn't any government agency that issues such permits, and Microsoft never produced any evidence that they had any permits. It is completely standard practice for PR to deny legal wrongdoing, whether or not it existed.   On an unrelated note, a big chunk (I don't know how much) of the Internet fallout that happened was an astroturf campaign by Interference Inc. I don't know if 10% of the downvotes on comments like this one come from II employees, and 90% from "real" redditors, or if 90% come from II employees, and 10% from redditors, but I do know that II specializes in this type of astroturf PR campaign, and was quite involved in actively participating in Internet damage control (posts and up/downvotes on web sites like reddit, edits to wikipedia, etc.) after the incident. 
Every other device and PC other than the iphone supports Flash. Flash is a standard component to the majority of web sites today. This is about common sense more than anything else. Everyone but the apple folks see this as a major issue. You guys just give reasons why it's a good thing. But the Iphone os is basically OSX. Iphones could run flash and then you would have a fully functioning browser. I would love for the evolution of the web to move much quicker than it currently is but don't pretend you aren't getting fucked by this.

Lately I've been treating the secondary as nothing but a clarification or dry hopping step, but it took a while to come to that point.  I was convinced early on that the fermentation needed that second step to complete.  It's amazing how much pseudo-science based advice there is in the online homebrew community.  Guess nothing can substitute for your own experience.  At this point I'm thinking I should have racked last week and given it a week for clarity's sake, could have been bottling today.

How is a regulation that allows only one ISP in an area ensure competition?  Are you a economics major?    It's a joke, I know it's not socialist technically. It's socialist in the sense that they have no competition so they have no incentive to improve their product, in the same way soviet Russia failed.  It's also "socialist" in the sense that they call it a utility so it's regulated to be one company like water.   The problem with that is the internet is not like water at all, it's a network and having more then one connection is not a bad thing like it would be with water pipes.  The network gets more efficient the more connections it has, not less, like your standard utilities.    Actually it seems that having more then one electricity connection would have helped prevent a lot of our power vulnerabilities and massive failures like we saw with the east coast in 2003.  It's almost like we can't trust corporations to make our policies for us.  
Never saw that happen. People are usually polite but reserved, and generally don't stare, so I guess they'd ignore it. There's an automatic social formality that people stick to. Despite the fact that I was probably the first naked white guy a lot of these Korean dudes had ever seen, I never thought that I was being stared at.  In the women side, on the other hand, my foreigner friends would tell me that Korean women would be *really* friendly. One girl I knew was getting her back scrubbed down before she even knew what was happening.  Meanwhile, here in Toronto, the last time I went to work out at my local gym I noticed that they're installing separate shower stalls. It's not because I want to oggle naked people or anything that this disturbs me - it's just a subtle sign that we're becoming even more insecure with our bodies. We're letting the advertising and fashion industries win.

I am no expert on older firearms but this was a beauty. I payed 120 bucks for it. The only problem I have had is this: When firing after about 20 or so rounds, the bolt starts to jam. I'm pretty sure it's the ammo. (lacquered steel polish yellow tip made in 1955) other than the jams, the ammo is perfect (Never misfires) anybody have this same problem with an m44 or this polish ammo?

A fruit diet is a bad idea.  You're going to try and limit your calories, which will make you hungry, and then satisfy those cravings with fruit and therefore, fructose.  Although superior to drinking a bunch of soda, the harm of running on fructose is significant.  It causes insulin insensitivity and is absorbed so quickly, your blood sugar levels will be spiking and dropping all day.  A better plan would involve cutting out fried food, white bread and processed snacks.  Stick to meat, eggs, whole grains and lots of veggies/fruits and dairy, and get in that exercise!  Drink water instead of juice/soda, and don't try and strip down your meals to have no caloric content. Food is your friend here, not your enemy.  Butter, in reasonable quantities early in the day, can be your best friend. Rushing weight loss is a plan for failure.  sincerely, someone who lost 20 pounds once I STOPPED DIETING LIKE A CRAZY PERSON.

After watching the film for the first time I felt drained.  It's as if they filmed one of Stanley Kubrick's nightmares. It is true that it does demand too much of the viewer and I would still consider it a great film.  It treats film, as an art form, with respect and that is all too rare.

Of course it wasn't defined it was being used incorrectly.  It specified one type of data.  Using it with another type was wrong hence why it wasn't defined.  Are you suggesting that the documentation contains expected return values for every type of incorrect data that's passed?
Hyperbole.  A philosophy cannot be responsible for anything.  Responsibility rests with the people that use/abuse it.
Yes!  I stand corrected, I meant Colt 45.   It's been a while since I bought any one of those.   Heineken is the route for me now a days.....

I didn't dv you for posting this.  Somebody did.  But do you think that there might be some other social factors that contribute to these numbers?  Like race, poverty, and an under-industrialized region? 
I can't remember. I know it was about a house who tried to kill the family that lived there. Lights coming out of the celing and stuff, at the end the father cuts down a telephone pole to crush the house that's on fire. Was really crazy. 
I lost my glasses just a few seconds after entering my very first mosh pit.  I bravely stood in the middle and acting as a traffic cop, trying (obviously in vain) to stop it so that I could search for them.   I kept searching and found them after a few rounds, untouched.

I was once playing darts at a bar, and like so many similar nights I could barely stand let alone hit anything I was aiming for. My cousin and teammate was getting pissed off which was in turn irritating me, and stuck his finger on the bulls-eye while mocking me telling me that that's what I needed to hit.  Sure enough, game-winning double bullseye through his fingertip. 
They tend to be really pontificatious (I made that word up just now) and "holier than thou", yes.  They also tend to be complete snobs about most movies or books, but have no problem fawning over the latest fad or big-traffic item, which is a major issue.  I follow their feed, but only look at certain items - I don't typically read any of their reviews or editorial type stuff.  I just use them for nerd/scifi news that I might have an otherwise hard time finding, unless they do something like an interview with someone I'm interested in.
It's a viral infection spread by mosquitoes. Some of the symptoms include fever, headache, chills, back pain, loss of appetite, nausea and vomiting.

Pre-Hellenic people became the Hellenic people who are the Greeks in Roman like Zeus became Jupiter. So today the stories that were saved from ancient times are the closest to the original version.

I didn't grow up working on cars, but I sure as fuck learned how to change the oil and spark plugs and filters once it became apparent that the alternative was paying a mechanic stupid amounts of money to do it for me.  Why people can't do the same with computers will always escape me.   The whole defeatist attitude of "I'm not a computer person" is fucking pointless.   **BECOME** proficient.

I took the time to transcribe every word from video, and not just the first 4 lines.

At first, I was completely scared. I feared Interpol, CIA agents coming for me, even my own local force (in other words, I was afraid the US would contact the police in my country and have me arrested). I was also afraid of the bondsman who bailed me out, and even felt a bit guilty about it at first (I even wanted to repay the $85,000 I still owed him). Then I got over it and live a new life.  I have a new name, I live in a house house, I have a new profession now and I am married. It would be nearly impossible to link me with my old life without extensive researches. Since these researches were never made in the 10+ years, I have no reason to believe they will be done now.
haha, did you really just equate a mainstream sport with sumo? that's a bit delusional, isn't it? it is your belief that soccer is "more religious than sumo", but that kind of devotion to the sport is not associated with religion at all, but more like *fanaticism*. if you can't tell the difference between the two, then your remarks are irrelevant.  sumo's throwing of the salts to ward off evil spirits, the various ceremonies involved, the devotion of one's life from childhood to the sport. in fact, sumo shares many qualities with the *samurai spirit*. *that* is a ritual. sumo is *ritualistic*. and you are a fool for even attempting to associate religion with soccer.  by the way, next time make sure you're using the correct account to post your replies. i just got a double post of an identical reply from two different accounts.

'Smile and hope for the best' is seldom an effective strategy, at least when dealing with issues more serious than being dragged along to a boring dinner party. 
People are also busy, and they should be able to rely on the media to, at the very least, "spoon feed" them information that is correct. Not everyone sits at a desk all day able to bum around the internet, and as much as I like to talk about responsibility, too, it is the media's responsibility before the individual's--there is just too much information out there for every layman to be expected to investigate on their own.  People relying on news and politicians for information is unavoidable. There should be laws against deliberate misinformation, is what I'm saying.

This is exactly the reason I've stopped speaking out against homoeopathic medicine as actively as I used to, although I did still speak out against it when someone I know was giving up treatment for a life threatening condition in favour of homoeopathic medicine. If the disease isn't going to cause permanent damage without medical treatment, then I certainly don't oppose someone taking homoeopathic medicines to make themselves feel better (even though I still laugh on the inside).

If you're interested in 35mm DIY pinholes, also check out the [matchbox pinhole](http://www.matchboxpinhole.com/). I made one of these myself last summer and it was a blast to use. Not quite as reusable as this model, though...    Be sure to keep a notebook with your exposure settings so that when you get the roll developed, you can get a feel for exposure times and lighting conditions. Oh, and also make sure you have access to a "real" lab; Walgreens isn't going to know what to do with the non-standard exposure size.

People hated all the time you spent on it in the first game.  I didn't mind so much and I had fun with the quests there, but I could understand the criticism.  Not only does it fit poorly with the theme of this game (ME2 was influenced by the Wild West -- you're in the lawless Terminus Systems trying to get together a team of outlaws for a suicide mission), but you spend a remarkable amount of time there for a game that's supposed to have a lot of travel and exploration.

ACLU filed an friend-of-court brief to permit corporate free speech.  They received quite a bit of negative press from their friends on the left wing.  So the ACLU considered dropping the brief and staying out of the case altogether.  Abrams persuaded the ACLU to stay in the fight on the corporate side for free speech.  Even now, the ACLU has remained silent on their share of the victory and wants to keep it hush hush.    The whole thing is funny, because they know it was the right thing, both legally and ethically.  Furthermore, the ACLU have had to pull campaign ads against Republicans in many past races.  Now they can run those ads to benefit the leftist political ideology that hates this decision - the irony is sweet.  Make no mistake.  The Democrat party and Obama, who ripped SCOTUS for this, are going to lead the charge for unions and other corporate partners to spend millions on their behalf.
For me, it was THE DAY AFTER- a lovely made for tv movie about how the suburbs go to heck after a nuclear war.  I don't envy my mom having to explain why the little boy on tv was crapping blood in the bathroom sink, or why the boy's mommy loaded everyone in the family car... and closed the garage door. Messed. Me. Up.
I did!  That movie was indeed freaky. It didnt help that I believed in UFOs at the time I saw it.
from my experience of nudist beaches and "clothing optional" resorts, I'd say that the vast majority of people who go naked should really be required to keep their clothes on. Most of them are 50+, fat, flabby and not exactly good looking. Eye bleach stations should be mandatory.  Your thoughts?

Open Source intelligence is a technical term in intelligence circles.  All it means is intel that can be gathered by say walking down a street and buying a newspaper in a foreign country, or say listening to the radio, watching the TV.  Open Source in this context only implies not covert.  Any news and media in the US would still be viewed as OSintel by other countries.

Not about me, so not my encounter, but still WTF enough to post:  In late high school, I get a call from a friend of mine. He asks what's up. I say nothing, what you up to?  He says "I'm at Perry's (his dad).  I just fucked Sheryl (his step mom)."  I could hear his smile through the phone and I had no idea what to say.  I still don't, and that was like 10 years ago. Our friend Jon summed it up best in my books, "Rob has no soul."
I suppose this counts as anecdotal evidence, but I personally have started a diet as of the first of the year- I have been exercising (not much- like 15 minutes a day of moderate-to-heavy activity) for about a month and a half prior, and got no results. Since starting my diet (and by diet, I mean I reduced my calorie intake by about 1000 calories per day, and tried to eat a little more wheat- other than that, didn't change a damn thing) I have lost about 9 pounds.  I don't like being the someone's-wrong-on-the-internet guy, but both my personal experience and various studies linked up above seem to point towards exercise being not terribly useful for pure weight loss.

I have access to my own B&amp;W developing so that'd be fine. Although I do wonder how these slightly blurry pinhole photos would look in B&amp;W.  Now, as for exposure, that is puzzling me. The dude in the video appeared to have pulled the exposure time out of a hat...."it's sunny...so maybe one or two seconds". I would think for accurate values one would need to determine the f-stop of the pinhole. I suppose dividing the distance between pinhole and film by its diameter will be the answer. Heck, one could then even use a light meter.

Ahem, are you a moderator, or something? Anyhow, the response to your questioning resides in the most interesting discussion with Sir Wackyvorlon. Relax, I'm just pondering a notion, not trying to shatter the conventions of physics. Besides, my craving for that Kool-aid stopped decades ago. :)

I don't know how you could disagree with my definition. It's pretty standard. There are different degrees of liberty and enslavement. For example, a slave on a plantation who is allowed to leave and do whatever he wants for 3 hours a day is more of a slave and has less liberty that a slave on a plantation who is allowed to leave and do whatever he wants for 6 hours a day.

I think sheet music can be very valuable for information not available on tabs (stroke directions, wahs, rests, song keys), but for most rock/pop guitar music it's not necessary.

Nope.  I come up with what to do on the weekends, I've tried to incorporate board games so at least we'll have something to DO while we're home, but, nope he never tries anything. 
You could even say that she (puts on glasses) wasn't the one.
No, I was just half-assed looking around, knowing for a fact they were gone forever and thinking about how to get to an optometrist before closing time. He was the one who found them. The blind man found his glasses in the ocean.
I think that depends greatly on what you're doing.  Sometimes, you're hired to read, whether it's a show band, a last minute fill in, a classical gig, a Real Book gig, recording session, etc.
you don't need that sort of thing for Mac OS.  It avoids fragmentation on it's own.  you have some other issue.
Well, I don't know anything still about The Gay Agenda, but I have learned that:  &gt;The mission of the Austin Lesbian/Gay Political Caucus shall be to unite and organize Austin  area lesbian, gay, bi-sexual and transgendered citizens and our friends and supporters in political action against all forms of discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender expression.

Of course.  I do find it interesting that all of the states at the top of the list are from the South, where there is a larger minority population who supposedly does not do as well at standardized tests.  There are fewer job opportunities, thus the theft and poverty.   Even if I were not a Christian I would fail to see religion as the connecting tissue between these stats.

Bad Taste is 1989, you had to have been a movie-goer/TV-watcher of that period, parodies of movies and TV action.  Theres comic elements of the Brit TV series the Professions' in Bad Taste. But the Professionals parodied themselves in some episodes. That one episode springs to mind, the one with the third CI5 officer on that bridge with the RPG waiting for the boat to come down the river.

If you ever wonder why there's poverty, hunger, war and other scourges of humanity, you can just look in the mirror.    Justice must be served.  People like you who live healthy, productive lives with good relationships, but who have not paid their debt to society are a prime cause of evil in the world.    I encourage you to be a man, do the right thing, and return to the United States to serve your full term.  Then, and only then, will you be *truly* free.  I don't know how you can live with yourself, knowing you've never been properly punished.  God bless America.    EDIT: **AAAAAARGH, I'M JUST JOKING!!!!! MY KARMA, MY BEAUTIFUL KARMA!!!!

&gt;If you think you can just change what you eat and not exercise you aren't going to get results.  Sorry, the science says otherwise.   Exercise is great for you. Just not helpful in the battle of the bulge.  This is probably a deeply held belief you've psyched yourself up with to make yourself go the gym every day.   You SHOULD keep going to the gym. It keeps your brain and blood in great shape and makes it much less likely you'll die of a cardiovascular problem. Doesn't really help the fat storage issue though.  Weight loss science changes year after year after year. You're chanting stuff that's from 4 years ago.    The reason I bring this up is people are suggesting "take her to the gym".  Just going to the gym, without diet, has as much chance of making her heavier as thinner.
You must be stupid.

Your perspective is screwed. Go on and tell me you would waste the best part of your life in jail. All of this would make sense if I even felt like I had committed a crime (which I don't).  Let's say you got to X and commit a crime. And X says you must purge 25 years in jail. You have a chance to run away to the United States. Would you? Just because a screwed, false, wrong system decides you should waste your life in jail doesn't mean you actually should. Your perspective is biased.  EDIT: Just realized you were trolling. My bad, joke's on me.

I did commit these crimes. As I said I do not make excuses for myself. Had I been simply at the wrong place at the wrong time, I wouldn't have ran away.  I did fear a bit about the bondsman, but it is relatively easy to change your name in my country, all other elements being the same. My attorney kept pushing and pushing the court date. He was awesome.

Cool. Ok tho one question. If they live believing a lie, but that lie doesn't impede and even helps a happy life, a good career, a family, helping the unfortunate, and a peaceful death...is it still "throwing their life away?"  I'm an atheist too, but I was raised in a freaky serious Christian denomination, and I still have a soft spot for the people there.  Did something happen in your life that made you hate Christians?

There's a huge difference between "Honey, I'm bisexual" and "Honey, I'm having a threeway relationship with two men behind your back."  I'd consider her a bad person to leave you after the first confession, and just as bad a person to stay with you after the second.

God is racist? WTF  Does god answer prayers or not? Does he effect positively the lives of his followers or not?  Look, if you ask ANY priest or pastor, they will lie that god answers prayers.

Don't be silly. None of those donations will go anywhere near west China.   Chances are that they are immediately pocketed by those who buy the pretty display case. Seriously, giving to any charity in China is worse than just throwing your money away. By giving money to these shysters, you are helping them carry out what is, for China, a sophisticated scam. Your change will be funding organised crime. Better off giving to DWB or any other international NGO.  Even in the world's least corrupt countries, charity fundraisers take a &gt;40% cut for raising the money. You can rest assured that in China it will be ~100%.

I'm playing it now, and I think I've spent half the playtime fucking around on Reddit while some NPC tells me his detailed life story.   Big thumbs up on Grim Fandango, though.

Things like this are why I'm glad I live in SF and why I will never leave.    You just don't get that sort of counter-protest absurdity anywhere else.  Instead of a challenging and potentially violent response from people who are angry, you just get someone saying "hey, we're crazy too and we're more creative than you look at us instead!".    It works so much better than violence or actually protesting in general.

What claims?  I am confused over this.  The Roman empire, especially towards the end, was massively militaristic.  Soldier were often fought for land and slaves.  Some historians have even argued the fall of Rome was a good thing for Europe.     That being said Rome is the perfect example of a lack of data, where it is hard to conclude anything strongly.  I am thinking you maybe a troll, as your post is contradictory - making claims without data then pronouncing that I should not make claims without data (which I have not even done).

At first, I was completely scared. I feared Interpol, CIA agents coming for me, even my own local force (in other words, I was afraid the US would contact the police in my country and have me arrested). I was also afraid of the bondsman who bailed me out, and even felt a bit guilty about it at first (I even wanted to repay the $85,000 I still owed him). Then I got over it and live a new life.  I have a new name, I live in a house house, I have a new profession now and I am married. It would be nearly impossible to link me with my old life without extensive researches. Since these researches were never made in the 10+ years, I have no reason to believe they will be done now.

Fun Fact #1: Irreversible's score is composed by [Thomas Bangalter, 1/2 of Daft Punk](http://www.discogs.com/Thomas-Bangalter-Original-Soundtrack-From-The-Motion-Picture-Irreversible/release/118416)  Fun Fact #2: From IMDB - "The first 30 minutes of the film has a background noise with a frequency of 28Hz (low frequency, almost inaudible), similar to the noise produced by an earthquake. In humans, it causes nausea, sickness and vertigo. It was the main cause of people walking out of the theaters during the first part of the film in places like Cannes and San Sebastian. In fact, it was added with the purpose of getting this reaction."  Awesome movie, saw it in the theaters.  On a big screen, the sound design and camera techniques are almost overwhelming, but add to the experience.

No; you can take out small personal loans and leave them in the bank, paying them over time, or you can keep a couple small credit cards and use them for everyday purchases then pay the balances in full every month (during the grace period, which usually means no interest accrues.

Imho, use whichever bathroom matches your general appearance. If I ran an establishment with restrooms, I'd never, ever think of giving a transgendered individual trouble for using a bathroom he or she was most comfortable with, but unfortunately most places aren't quite that tolerant/accepting yet.

There were some amazing looking guys there.  Unfortunately some of the hotter ones were 'pets' of the resident couples.  I was always impressed at how much nudists cared ab out their appearance and would shave/wax frequently.  
Ok  you just did not understand my post at all. In the begining of the korean war America was getting it's ass handed to it, they were about to be driven into the sea, they were almost ready to pack home when the tides of war changed and began to have more success, MacArthur went on a roll and succeeded in pushing back North Korean forces back a bit. Now MacArthur was under direct order from the president to not go up the 38 if there were any sign of Chinese opposition there, which there were, MacArthur said fuck it we can take those commies and engaged them, which was a really bad move on his part because the Chinese did not get the memo about American superiority and had a very different opinion about that, so they pushed back in force and the rest is history. 
Some people get really irrational when they're drunk.  When drinking: My mother would tell us she hated us and would threaten to kill herself. My father would tell me I was a whore just like my mother.  Afterward they wouldn't remember saying these things at all. Your GF probably won't either. So,  show her your iphone recording, make it a prerequisite to staying together that she can't drink that much, because you don't want to deal with her when she gets like that. 
This sounds very much like tracker music. What did you write this on?

I understand that Gideon bibles fall into a gray area concerning ownership, but what you're doing is still basically stealing. These bibles have been donated to the *hotel chain* for temporary use by individuals, not donated directly to *you.*  Since stealing is generally bad, you ought to put them back. If that's too impractical, you ought to at least stop stealing in the future.  Just a thought.
women are manipulative.. oh wait, that's not a stereotype, that's a fact.

My condolences regarding your father. I'm sure I can't yet even begin to understand the pain of losing a parent, and, although I probably can't help much since I always had my step-dad around to build and upgrade my computer, I am rather curious regarding one thing: what kind of computer did he leave you? Have you figured out the specs yet? It might just be a kickass gaming rig.  Then again, perhaps not, I don't think I saw a graphics card in the pics you put up.

&gt;however there is a BIG difference between a vanity press and a good publisher  Yes you see I do get this, but I also feel that it's time that reputable POD/vanity presses emerge where there *are* editors who get some kind of fee or royalty cut.  Then in terms of marketing there will be a need for mainstream media and reviewers to give these books - assuming they are deserving - equivalent attention to printed books.

It's not so much that i missed it, seeing as how i was born in 1987 and dont really have any clear memories of the 80's, and more specifically, my parents were not out of there minds and realized the only place for a young kid to be seeing movies was at the home...on VHS, so, essentially short circuit, in my mind is one hundred percent 90's...its also not the end of the world that we dont see eye to eye.

&gt; it's never going to come close to well coded C/++.  That's not true, i wish people would stop saying that. It's hard and a lot of work to implement, but possible.  Look up LUA , with [LUAJIT 2.0](http://luajit.org/luajit.html) for a language in a VM which comes very close to well coded C/C++.  About access to external APIs sure that's a good point for performance, but has nothing to do with wether the language is static/dynamic, VM'ed or JITed or whatever  EDIT: i suck @ markdown :'(
Correct - so is the problem private companies (by definitions, organizations of people created by voluntary arrangement to provide goods), or government (by definition, organizations of people who use coercion to enforce regulations and collect money)?

I'm sure they don't have that many cases where the suspect fits all those details. Reddit has your IP address in their logs. If some government entity _wanted_ to, I'm sure they could get it.

Well, there are examples where gates can ... gate ... to each other in close proximity, from SG-1 and Atlantis.  As an example, using the SGC gate to dig a hole in the ice-bound gate in Antarctica by adjusting coordinates or something.  Or any number of instances when the Goauld attack planets and dial gates.  Or when SG-1 is on Apohus' ship and they gate to Earth.  I don't think it's a plot hole, it probably just assumes the calculation/modification/adjustment/override is done by the ship.

Though there are so many accents on the British isles, I have trouble telling where a lot of people come from, and sometimes get the wrong country, entirely.

Heh. Let's crunch some numbers. (According to this article.)[http://arizona-travel.suite101.com/article.cfm/grand_canyon_skywalk_first_year] The skywalk is averaging 2000 tourists a day.  Let's say they're open for 300 days a year (holidays, bad weather, repairs, upgrades)  $40 bucks for the park $30 bucks for the skywalk  300x2000x70=$42,000,000   Now, let's be conservative and say that only half the visitors pony up for the photo.   1000x30x300=$9,000,000  All told, that's $51 million dollars, roughly with some fudging and guessing.   Now, obvious there are people to pay, maintenance, inspections, overhead and all that. But remember that taxes on tribal ventures are lower and that many of the employees are Tribal members themselves, who also benefit from the communal monies.   Pony up White Man. Pony up.  
Sorry. Most stoves (electric or gas) have a self clean cycle that super heats the oven and turns any grease and food residue into nothing but ash. The oven actually locks itself and goes crazy for a few hours and can't be unlocked until it cools down. If your stove doesn't have this feature then you might try setting it as high as it will go and letting it run like that for 1 1/2- 2 hours and then allow it to cool back down to 150* or so.

To be pretentious is to be "characterized by assumption of dignity or importance." The word doesn't apply to someone who is *actually* dignified and important. There are many ways to insult the most powerful man in the world, but to call him pretentious just doesn't make sense. It's like trying to insult Einstein by calling him a "know-it-all."

It's about the french high wire artist who walked between the Twin Towers in the mid seventies.  John Pilger's The New Rulers of The World- It's a documentary about politics and power, using indonesia as a case study. Powerful stuff.  Capturing the friedmans - What started off as a documentary about a kids party clown turned into a statling film as accusations of Child Pornography are levelled at the clowns father.

I loved on the 17th floor of a biuilding with a swipe card entry system. One day i went out and forgot my card, so when i got back, i phoned my friend, who also lived on the 17th floor if he could come down an open the door; ever the lazy bastard he said he'd throw his card out of the window (his window was directly above the door). Ten seconds later a card came flying down in front of me, swipes through the reader and opened the door. This was a card reader that usually took 3-4 attemts to work at the best of times, and he'd done it first time from 150ft above.

I live on the 6th floor of my apartment complex.  I am in the corner apartment and there is an alleyway with an assortment of dumpsters adjacent to my building.  Sometimes, if my roomates or I are too lazy to walk the trash down the hallway to the trash chute, we will throw our trash off our balcony and try and get it into the dumpsters.  You name it, we've thrown it; glass bottles, old stereos, watermelons, cats, etc.  Well, anyway, on this particular day I was throwing an empty heineken bottle off.  The bottle missed the dumpster, and landed in the alleyway, on the cement, where it remained UNBROKEN (this is a 6 story fall).  I'm talking not even a chipped.  It was so mind-blowing I had to go down and retrieve it to see for myself.  Okay, so it was probably just a freak coincidence but I still like to take credit for it.  It's good to take pride in what you do.

The ACLU also has a history of defending churches, conservatives and other folks who undergo challenges to free speech.  They're remarkably unbiased when it comes to protecting free speech.  The problem, as they and Greenwald point out, is that challenging speech is unconstitutional, and we can't deny it to anyone.  What we need to do is attack the notion that corporations are people with protected rights, given that they're organizations that can drop one identity and adopt a new one the way other people can't.

I wasn't referring solely to weight, but that people whose image of foreign countries comes from the media or limited travel get a strange idea of what passes for average. I can say the same things about the image of French and Russian women.  There are beautiful woman all around the world, but I don't think it's possible to say "women in country X are Y," because there's always variation.   Country-of-origin fetishes always bothered me somehow.  The most beautiful woman I ever dated was from Spain, sexiest was from France, cutest was from Viet Nam, hottest was from Russia, smartest was from Poland, chubbiest was from Finland, most determined was from China, skinniest was from Hawaii, most energetic was from Germany, sweetest was from Taiwan, most stylish from New York, and the nicest was from Japan. But I don't think these single experiences translate into generalizations I can make about their respective countries.

I think you are jumping to conclusions.  My wife is terrified of divorce and is not going to try and "reconvert" me.  I've already told her I'll keep coming to church with her, and that's good enough.  She really isn't the kind of person who can make your life hell.  I know that sounds funny, but you'd just have to meet her.  She has the complete peace-maker personality and avoids confrontation at all costs.     The LDS church actually does NOT break up marriages, institutionally.  Meaning, if one person leaves, they don't try to break up the marriage.  They tell you to do your best and be a good person, and just hope that the spouse will come around.   Some churches, particular scientology and Jehovah's Witnesses, do try and break up families.   Lots of people in the mormon church are "mixed-member" families.

Yeah, the first thing I did when I finished is look up details of how it was made. Those 30 minutes as he goes through "The Rectum" are absolutely amazing and so captivating. Really really unsettling.  I'd love to catch a cinema screening at some point and then take some people to shock them (and talk to them about it afterwards).
hahaha great answer. see edit above
The best lawyers "allow" it to happen, too.  But, because they're good lawyers, they get themselves one step closer to "judge" in exchange for selling out their client.
I'm not really queen on them either.
I got the feeling my Lawyer friend in Honk Kong would concur.  I asked him recently how can an author sue google in China over a book she can not publish in China he responded in shock, "Laws?  Laws in China?"
Pretty easy. I mean, we can open and close doors. Dinosaurs aren't smart enough to do that... and they don't have thumbs. I can't think of one situation where a dinosaur has gotten through a closed door.

Bad Taste is 1989, you had to have been a movie-goer/TV-watcher of that period, parodies of movies and TV action.  Theres comic elements of the Brit TV series the Professions' in Bad Taste. But the Professionals parodied themselves in some episodes. That one episode springs to mind, the one with the third CI5 officer on that bridge with the RPG waiting for the boat to come down the river. 
&gt;Correct - so is the problem private companies (by definitions, organizations of people created by voluntary arrangement to provide goods), or government (by definition, organizations of people who use coercion to enforce regulations and collect money)?  Private companies are organizations of people created by voluntary arrangement to *collect money*. Providing goods is irrelevant to most US companies, and they only do it if they have to. If they can find an alternate means of collecting money, they do so.  Government does not exist to collect money. It exists to see that the goals set by those who hold power are achieved. In a democratic society, these goals would be those of the public at large. Collecting money is a means of achieving those goals.  Furthermore, you assume that *both* can't be the problem. Large private companies are able to buy influence with the government to use its power for their own ends.
I think it's pretty obvious that this doesn't say anything about religion itself.  It's that a tyrant will wear religion or *any popular political ideology* as a badge to seem like his subjects, without necessarily caring too much for that religion or political ideology.  Tyrants are pragmatic.  The badge may be anything.
Fiber comes in 2 types: Insoluble and soluble. You likely are only negatively affected by insoluble fiber. Soluble fiber may help you quite a bit if it works with you like normal people.  Metamucil is insoluble fiber.  Oatmeal is (mostly) soluble fiber.  Soluble fiber slows digestion in most people. Insoluble fiber speeds digestion in most people (and functions as a gentle laxative).  Steel cut oats have a much higher fiber content than pressed or instant oats. The pressing (or pressing and parboiling of instant oats) removes significant amounts of the fiber.  Here is a episode of Good Eats which show you how to cook them (immediately or overnight) and present numerous nutritional facts  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH8tEw938RM&amp;feature=related http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-j-Hkihja-0&amp;NR=1

Peggle at least requires a sliver of thought and strategy. Halo is so simple it could be played by an ape. Same with Mass Effect 2, now.
&gt;Just because Rush Limbaugh, big fat bag of jackass that he is, doesn't understand ...  Who's bringing up Limbaugh?  Who cares what he says?  Your initial post admitted the incidents.  The first "incident" was hardly an "incident".  Unless you're denying the whole scandal, then it was a consistent and repeated effort on the part of a group at that location.  This isn't an "incident".   If a bank were to, for years, practice fraud to cheat customers without their awareness, you wouldn't call it an "incident".  And again, unless you're denying that it happened, or that they did it for absolutely no reason whatsoever, then your basic premise that scientists don't lie because they don't have something to gain is wrong.

I created a throw-away account just for this comment and question. Over the years I've found that I'm ONLY turned on by girls who are masochistic and submissive. I used to think that I was a total freak for this, but grew to enjoy it instead. I lust hard for girls who enjoy pain. Key word here is 'enjoy'. With that off my shoulders I have a question.

It does say "must", which means that if the condition is not present, then the resulting situation cannot follow, at least according to common usage.

Actually, I don't know... I guess his responses are always money-related.  And I insist that it really doesn't have to do with money.  6 months, not a single flower from the ground even.  6 months, not a single date that he planned on his own.  He just really doesn't try, and if he does, he doesn't try hard enough.  And the sad part is, it's so simple, so easy and effortless, and I treat him like gold.

You're kind of putting words in my mouth, aren't you?  Race is not so much the issue as the culture surrounding race.    It seems that you have your mind made up.

Things like this are why I'm glad I live in SF and why I will never leave.    You just don't get that sort of counter-protest absurdity anywhere else.  Instead of a challenging and potentially violent response from people who are angry, you just get someone saying "hey, we're crazy too and we're more creative than you look at us instead!".    It works so much better than violence or actually protesting in general.

I'm obviously biased, but I am annoyed that Amazon used the word "monopoly" when referring to Macmillan's own products -- can't say I agree with the usage of the term.

The tech specialist can also die if the fireteam leader is not a prime candidate.  I lost Legion because I had Zaeed lead the first fireteam.  But the game incredibly arbitrary.  In theory I should have lost no one, but I lost Legion and Mordin.  Legion died because I assigned Zaeed as fireteam lead, but Zaeed should perform great because he co-founded the Blue Suns.  Clearly he has leadership experience -- definitely more than Jacob.  I lost Mordin because I assigned him head of the defense team.  WTF?  This dude led an STG team on two successful suicide missions, and many recon missions in hostile territory before and after that.  How the hell is he not suited for the job?

Uh huh. So an article attacks all opponents of prorogation as being ill-informed and ignorant. When I object to the article, you dismiss my views, mischaracterize them as personal attacks on the author, and lay down some arbitrary requirements ("suggested reading") that, if not met, are reason to dismiss my views again as those of someone who just doesn't understand.  And now, when I refuse to play the game your way, you'll tell yourself, see, another person who just can't live up to your intellectual standards.  You must be a lot of fun at parties.

Actually, you will find plenty of egg-laying operations on the planet that operate in this fashion. Perhaps you've been stuck in first world cities all of your life, but I suggest you travel, even just a little bit.  The solution would be to make things decentralised and individualised. If people raise their own, and just sell to the surrounding community, then there is no issue here. Small scale is key to commercial viability along with being humane and environmentally friendly. Saying something is impossible is just absurd, you're closing off your mind to finding possibilities when you do that.

Most ovens of recent vintage, maybe.  But the thing is, the clean cycle operates at something like 900 F.  Non-clean temps max out at 500 or 550.

Then you are an authoritarian fool that helps create these messes and does nothing more than to try to steer markets. You also try to be authoritarian with your social outlook. Haven't you learned? Social programs are massive failures in the U.S. by and large. I think you'd be pretty upset if conservatives were the supermajority in congress and tried to force their world view on you. Quite hypocritical. You're also obviously biased.  The reason we have a government is to protect property rights and individual liberties. Sadly that has been horribly skewed due to Lincoln/FDR. The U.S. is where it is today not because they try to socially engineer their country or they tried to meddle with markets, but because they got out of the way of business and didn't get involved in wars.

Education  I got an education from kindergarten to 12th grade.  It was 100% free to me.  Of course, now that I'm older I repay the kindness by paying for other people's education (taxes).  Then I earned a bachelor degree in business administration - paid for 100% (including books) by my employer.  Sure, it took me seven years to complete, but it's all mine.  They even gave me a $10,000 stock award for completing the degree.

Not a movie, but a cartoon series.  I can't remember what it was, may have been transformers, but there was a scene where a kid about my age fell asleep in bed with one of his legs hanging over the side.  The foot slid down and rested on the floor, which was apparently required for this evil madman to open up some sort of portal connecting his ceiling with the kid's floor.  Through the portal he was able to grab hold of the kids foot and pull him through despite screams of protest which woke the  father who tried frantically to prevent his son from being dragged into some swirly portal leading who-knows-where.  It was years before I could allow my foot to touch the floor while in bed.

I guess ME1 was a little long winded running around the citadel but it could have been a hell of a lot worse. My only complaint about ME1 was managing weapon inventory, Eirches was right though, they over corrected in that area as well as in citadel quest and level design.   I'd say on a whole though the fixes in ME2 were all for the better, for ME3 they should take a lesson from boarderlands on looting/weapon design.   Also, they should phase out the hacking somewhere in the middle of the game so you can auto hack, i got pretty sick of connecting the dots.

Great list.  Most mushroom cultivation is based on having live spawn grown on sterile media, which is impractical in a total collapse.   There are techniques for growing magic mushrooms using ordinary canning jars and spores from a fresh mushroom, which are reasonably common around cattle.  The Chinese and Japanese cultivated shitakes by stacking fresh logs on one that was already producing.  But shitakes aren't native here, and they need a bit more help.

&gt;People relying on news and politicians for information is unavoidable. There should be laws against deliberate misinformation, is what I'm saying.  I agree with you 100%. It's a shame that Fox News uses the slogan of fair and balanced and yet is allowed to show opinion based "news". They should be held to some sort of standard when it comes to what they say since Fox is the most watched news network (or any news source for that matter) . I have a friend who believes everything on Fox is fair and balanced and will argue over any point until he is blue in the face, it is one of the most frustrating things I care to be around.

I wonder why they never did a Highlander sequel.  I mean, other than the fact they kind of wrapped the whole thing up in the one.  They could have done a prequel, or followed some other immortal.  Of course, that would have been pretty depressing since you knew they had to die at the end.  On second thought, never mind.

Your perspective is screwed. Go on and tell me you would waste the best part of your life in jail. All of this would make sense if I even felt like I had committed a crime (which I don't).  Let's say you got to X and commit a crime. And X says you must purge 25 years in jail. You have a chance to run away to the United States. Would you? Just because a screwed, false, wrong system decides you should waste your life in jail doesn't mean you actually should. Your perspective is biased.  EDIT: Just realized you were trolling.

Well, there really isn't much you could do after your hero becomes super-human with no weaknesses. I suppose any sequels would have to take place mostly, if not entirely, in the real world where Neo wouldn't be any more powerful than anyone else. There would have to be some sort of internal conflict overshadowing everything because a movie where you just have a couple of epic fight scenes and nothing else would be really boring.

I lost my virginity to a prostitute in Amsterdam after prematurely ejaculating during a handjob, REPAYING her for another session, getting insulted on my form (because, as mentioned earlier, I was a virgin), being forced into finishing, and then going baby-dick limp inside of her at the extreme amount of pressure to finish (her exact quote upon realizing this was, "Limp dick doesn't fuck"). That's how I lost my virginity. It cost me 150 US dollars, but it is the greatest story I have. And that kind of makes it worth it.

And the Greek stories became Roman stories and the Roman people were slowly transformed into a Germanic people and the Germanic people spread across the waters to America transmitting culture and the stories.    To make out that Disney has done something wrong by taking these stories and "kidifying" them is just stupid.  Anything they have done has been more than most other people are doing to promote interest in Greek mythology.  Perhaps the kids that watch these movies will become motivated to seek out more information on it.   They are unlikely to do so with nothing to go on.  The stories themselves are by no means pure.

that wasn't a particularly serious suggestion, just an example of the domain knowledge reddit has that could be used to make their search useful. maybe you are searching for the joke comment and not the article, anyway. search should be designed to maximise the possibility that a person finds what they are looking for. keywords are terrible for places like reddit where the range of possible keywords to apply to an article is essentially unbounded.  what keywords would you use to tag this submission, for example.

What about a boiling interest and basic/conversational skills? I'd probably join the Navy just to master Russian and put it to use, but getting stuck with a language like Arabic or Chinese would make it a very long, tedious, and regrettable six years. 
If you're into science at all I highly recommend [Cosmos](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0081846/), hosted and narrated by Carl Sagan. It is quite long, but definitely worth it.
Hot brown. It's an open faced sandwich with a thick slice of bread, turkey, ham, white gravy, tomato, cheddar cheese, and bacon. Bake the assembled sandwich until the cheese is melted and the bacon is crispy.  It's the traditional brunch meal on Kentucky Derby day. We throw a Derby party every year and bake them by the tray.
You absolutely should not worry about it, ride the stink out of it and give it the periodic clean and lube.  If you're talking about mostly smooth dirt roads or paths then it will last thousands of miles if you give it minimal care.  If it's rough singletrack then it will get beatup faster but it's a mountain bike, that's what it's made for.
Ask them what they're most interested in. Tell them that you don't want to bore with everything they already know. Make it interesting and cool. Show them Photoshop or how to use iTunes. Picasa? Make it fun for them.

Gotta love Reddit....
One of the rules was that no cameras were allowed.  I remember once the owner saw someone with a camera, took it from them and threw it in the pool.
Sorry..  I don't get this reference and I used to live there, so it'd be interesting to know what's up.  EDIT: Thanks all, I'd seen bits of it ages ago as a kid, it's now on my to-watch list.
Why post on Reddit, other than getting upvotes? There's nothing wrong with what you're doing, but come on!
[Here's mine](http://imgur.com/m2fR9.jpg).
Napoleon was not a tyrant in the context of post revolutionary France.  Compared to what French people dealt with before and in the immediate aftermath of the Revolution, Napoleon was a massive improvement.  It is misrepresenting that agreement to suggest it was to make Napoleon seem to be god fearing or pious. It was just to appease catholics who had been oppressed during the Revolution.  He was not crowned by the pope, and did not recognize Catholicism as the state religion.  The deal that was struck was hardly favorable to the Church, and no Catholic could seriously consider Napoleon a pious man as a result.
In my post I only mentioned 2 inches.

Not to be a jerk, but do you think you deserved time in jail for your actions? How do you justify the path you chose? Do you think that your "stupid mistake" didn't deserve to be punished? Surely if you were facing such a long time in prison, it wasn't a single mistake and it most certainly wasn't a small one.  e: Oh jeez did I upset reddit by asking the OP valid questions? Maybe he shouldn't do an AMA if he expected everyone to support what he did.
Was there much tension between those who were there for a "naturalist" lifestyle and those who were there for sexual thrill?  How did it manifest itself?    What was the general attitude towards Homosexuality by the members?

&gt; The word doesn't apply to someone who is actually dignified and important  Self-important maybe.   &gt; There are many ways to insult the most powerful man in the world  While I concede that he is by any measure one of the most powerful men in the world, how does that confer importance or dignity? Only if he's a tyrant is his power important to me, but if he uses power tyrannically... he has no human dignity worth speaking of. And how can one have any real dignity when the only reason people treat you as important is that you are powerful?  I mean, I understand that you're just a monkey. Monkeys worship the alpha male. I get that. But aren't you even just a little self-aware of this?

May I ask, how's your sexual life, if any?
Wait a minute, did you just call me retarded because I fall asleep easily? Ha, BIIARU, I've a retort for you!   BIIARU:  I disagree! 
I'm spoofing mine, am I still eligible? 
I don't see how that would happen in humans. I suppose any possible "super fucked up beasts" would be a product of nurture, not nature.
What was the weirdest treatment you experienced or heard about?
Yes. Electricity play requires the right equipment, glad you are ok. I could tell a few stories myself, hah.   So let me ask then, what was the most pain inducing act that you have enjoyed and would do again?
you can grow oyster mushrooms no problem in a collapse type situation.  dehydrated they're ~30% protein.  they're extra great because you dont need a lot of light to grow them.  you could even do it underground as long as you can provide a small amount of light a few hours a day.  button mushrooms you can grow in complete darkness.  hows that for a convenient and hide-able food growing operation.  fyi button and portabello (same species i think.. or very close) should always be cooked before eating or they're semi toxic.
&gt;The US is about 40 times as large as the UK, but only has about 5 times the population. Obviously laying fiber across such an enormous area is an astronomical expense, and right now we don't have the cash flow to do it.  That argument is an irrelevant distraction. Some guy in a shack in Wyoming being unable to get fast internet has no relevance to the fact that major cities are languishing.  &gt;I currently have an 8Mbps connection, with 20Mbps available, and it suits us well as very heavy internet users.  I thought my 56k modem were hot shit too until cable modems were finally rolled out in my area (after many years of promises that they'd be doing so really soon). Turned out I was wrong.  Youtube never would have happened with modems. What isn't happening because we aren't moving forward?

No movie, but did anyone ever read "Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark" or "More Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark"?  The illustrations in those books freaked me out for years.
Here is how BIIARU replied, in my mind:   &gt;It's true! My mind races when I attempt to fall asleep. I can't get it too stop! edit: Like the time I went hiking up a mountain with my six sexiest friends, and two kids! We ran out of food on the first day, and instead of going back to our truck (about 100m away), we decided to start eating the youngest, and healthiest first. My youngest son was quite tasty, but my daughter tasted pretty bad (like it was rotten, or something.) All I can think about is: What would I taste like? And "Damn, the girl would have tasted better if we didn't chase her down, or use the truck to run her over!"
just pointing out that the website is completely biased.  It's an anti-circ crowd in there and they're not telling the whole story on half their material.

I'm not trying to be politically correct.  I made the edit because there are Asian nations that really are doing quite well for themselves, despite a less-than-stellar performance during the Industrial Revolution.  Hell, most just plain skipped it.  But you're right in suggesting that a lot of people are too concerned with being PC to talk about how things are.  Also, I'm not aware of any research that finds different races with any less capacity for intelligence.  Phrenology when out of style after the 19th century, if I'm not mistaken.

you did it all right. call your insurance and see what their policy on hit and runs are though, sometimes, even with just liability you'll be covered.   totaled? completely? it can't be fixed? then you'd better blue book it, see how much the world say's it's worth. probably his insurance will do the same thing, but do it just to make sure when they come through, they're not screwing you over.

Depends on details of why the credit report is bad. A friend of mine passed the strictest background investigation that DoD gives (for a TS/SCI clearance) despite having his credit completely wrecked by his felon father fraudulently opening accounts in his name. His clearance took about a year longer than normal to get, but he got it in the end. And he didn't have any trouble actually joining the Air Force.
Great list.  Most mushroom cultivation is based on having live spawn grown on sterile media, which is impractical in a total collapse.   There are techniques for growing magic mushrooms using ordinary canning jars and spores from a fresh mushroom, which are reasonably common around cattle.  The Chinese and Japanese cultivated shitakes by stacking fresh logs on one that was already producing.  But shitakes aren't native here, and they need a bit more help.

It's currently (or was?) the most expensive and fastest production car in the world.  Apparently it's really easy to drive as well.    &gt;on Top Gear, the car has received considerable praise from all 3 presenters. Jeremy Clarkson declared the Veyron "the greatest piece of engineering ever. No, I'm sorry, this is the greatest car ever made and the greatest car we will ever see in our lifetime.  Then they raced it against a formula 1 racer  &gt;While the F1 was quicker off the line and remained ahead until both cars were going roughly 200 kilometers per hour, the Bugatti then overtook its competitor during the climb from 200 to 300 km/h, and emerged the victor. Hammond has stated that he did not use the Veyron's launch control in order to make the race more interesting.  Because I'm sure you're super interested in cars.

Last summer, me and the wife found a entire patch of 4 and 5 leaf clovers. Soon, it was out-competed by its healthier non-mutants, but it was incredible.   Later that year, I found a 4 leaf clover next to a bus stop.  In HS, I was playing darts at a friend's house, and got all my dots in the smallest center eye. Even did a goofy under-the-leg toss.  In College, was playing penny poker, jokers wild. The cards were shuffled, and I got 4 aces + a joker. I managed to keep my poker face, and cleared out almost everyone at the table.

What do you think of the theory that interracial mating 'causes crazy people like with dogs? You know how some breeds, let's say rottie and German shepard, just shouldn't be crossed or they may make a super fucked up beast?   I've seen it happen. They can turn out fine though and very cute.   But anyway, back to my question, do you think that if you had a baby with someone from a different race that it could have the same affect and stuff?

A fully hacked system has no need for burning discs for games. Just look at the 360. With a fully hacked system people are installing games to the hard drive and playing them off of that. Same goes for Wii, Xbox 1, and PS2. Once we can execute our own code, we can hijack the disc reads and make them read from wherever we want.

While I do use Quodlibet (right now in fact). I am frustrated by their boolean syntax. As I understand it, there is no simple way of saying anything containing 'bob dylan' or 'moonbeams' where one is artist and the other is an album.   I get this: artist =|(bob dylan, throw me the statue)  but as far as I can tell there's no simple or syntax.
Not really...  Some of my friends have likely had to censor themselves. As for family, and her friends everyone has been accepting.

Keywords are the only way to do it.  Adding comments to searching does not help find a link.  Remember what reddit is.  Links.  Search should help you find a link you want to find.  If you want comment searching use google.  But if reddit were to start doing that, it would be separate of the normal search.  Because reddit is a link aggregator.  Search should help you find those links.  Currently searching titles doesn't do a whole lot to find links that relate to certain things.
No I don't expect to be upvoted.   Also, you are projecting.

This is a dumb thing to say. Why? How?

Things like this are why I'm glad I live in SF and why I will never leave.    You just don't get that sort of counter-protest absurdity anywhere else.  Instead of a challenging and potentially violent response from people who are angry, you just get someone saying "hey, we're crazy too and we're more creative than you look at us instead!".    It works so much better than violence or actually protesting in general.

Good job on the music.  The mix is clear, the sounds are well defined.  I think that if you wanted, you could tighten up the levels a bit. I think this song could also work with a 'thicker' sound.

Sorry, this explanation is based on science folklore (refuted, no less).   Sliding on snow (or ice) is not caused by pressure-induced water melting. Your children would have to be as heavy as elephants for this effect to be seen.    It is the friction of motion that melts the ice and creates the lubricating layer. Pressure has nothing to do with it.  Link:[Skating and science](http://www.skridsko.net/klubbar/data/science.html)   Now, back to the OP's question. Friction produces the same amount of frictional heat in the case of one sled with two kids or two sleds with two kids. That means that the same amount of lubricant (liquid water) will be created. However, when there are two sleds, it is spread more thinly (the contact area is twice as much). This probably accounts for the difference.

On the contrary, assholes who say that socialism has not been vilified enough have not been responsible for the deaths of tens of millions of people or the destruction of untold amounts of wealth, so I'd have to disagree.
I did this in the summer. I was already in fairly, moderately, good shape or at least I'd like to think so. I didn't need to lose any additional weight, but I wanted to see if I could get that ripped look. Alas, I came no where close to that, but my overall physique definitely improved.   The intro test is deceiving. The actual videos are harder than they look, because they pack a lot in an hour. I had trouble keeping up with them until I was halfway through the program. The Plyo video will have you at deaths door the first few times you attempt it. No joke.   Towards the end it got pretty boring and repetitive though, but overall it's not bad. Buy it for a discount on Craigs list.
Is it the erection itself that's frowned upon? or is it displaying it like a trophy? Were the ones getting erections generally looked down at just for getting an erection? Does something similar apply to women getting particularly noticeably wet, as in you can smell it wet?

I'm Canadian. We have fairly significant social programs and subsidy programs and had one of the best outcomes in the developed world after the collapse.

Look at your lobbyists and reckless corporate culture for the source of your woes.

I'm going to share another awesome UAV tactic:  It's the perfect weapon to take down the apache and the black hawk. Just **ram** the enemy helicopter, fly under or above it and push it up/down (apparently the UAV weighs enough to push the big choppers around, who knew?) 99% of the time this will cause the enemy to crash into the ground, and it won't even damage the UAV.  Also it's fucking hilarious.

Choosing between sources that for various reasons provide you select information is a blatant denial of intelligence. It might not meet the technical qualifications of the term 'closed source intelligence', but the effect is similar. I must say though that I am by no means saying that the media in the U.S. is as bad as it is in China.

When I was eight or so, I went on vacation to Kezar lake (where Stephen King lives I think). One night I stayed up way past my bedtime watching a movie, the title of which I have never really figured out. It was about these aliens that come and abduct several people in a small town, leaving only a group of junior high school students to save the world. The aliens had these copper plates they stuck into their heads or something, and these plates were integral to the plot of the movie. It's weird that that's pretty much the only bit of the movie I remember explicitly, but the impression of how scared it made me for a long time is still with me at 27.

Here's the thing, no matter where in the world we go, whatever race we speak of, the religious are overwhelmingly worse off. Can you explain this? Forget about America. Why is it that the dumb ones are more religious (do dumb people tend to believe in god more perhaps?)? Is religion a symptom?

thoughts on monsanto?
actually, the most important item on this could be shelter depending on your environment. if its winter in lets say, Vermont, the cold will kill you faster than a lack of water, besides, snow is essentially water. if you are in the desert, maybe shelter isn't as important, although it gets cold there as well. most survivalist handbooks say SWFF -&gt; **S**helter, **W**ater, **F**ire, **F**ood, in that order.  see: [survival topics](http://www.survivaltopics.com/survival/the-5-basic-survival-skills/) for more info, although signaling is not as important WTSHTF. if you want to ask this question there, you may receive more expert/ more specific advice.

It's the same for all "all star" games.  Pitchers in baseball don't reach the speeds they do in games.  There is no defense in the NBA.  I rarely see a check in the NHL.  This is an exhibition that matters little to anyone.  The only sport that gets it close to a real game is baseball, but that's due to the sport itself as opposed to any effort from the league.

I have a question about natural selection and was hoping you guys could provide some insight about it.   If there was an organism that was immortal or nearly immortal would you consider that organism to be the fittest even if it has no means to reproduce? Is being able to reproduce a prerequisite for being fit?   Also, how much weight should environment factors be considered when determining the fitness of an organism. For example, if an organism lived, reproduced a bit but died in an extreme environment, how would it compare to an organism that lives and reproduces in a very easy environment.

You. Are. Fascinating.

Somebody posted a link today to a recording of a family in a rental car with the accelerator stuck ... the car was up to 120 mph.  They called 911 but before the operator could suggest anything (too busy asking them their location, as if that was relevant), they crashed.  Sadly the driver was a transportation safety inspector, but he never thought to put the car in neutral.  Instead, he urged the other passengers to pray, which was ineffective.

I'm not so sure about that. I did a google search, and [this](http://www.legalzoom.com/legal-articles/School-Lockers-What-can-teacher.html) article says otherwise.  &gt;School searches are only justified according to the Supreme Court "**when there are reasonable grounds** for suspecting that the search will turn up evidence that the student has violated or is violating either the law or the rules of school."  Granted, it seems like there will usually be "reasonable grounds" for searching a locker. The point is that they can't do it for no reason at all, like in the game.

I didn't mean that he was a tyrant in that he was oppressive. Obviously he led to good change in government.   The "illegal treatment" could refer to Catholics against a non-Catholic man as emperor, and also the royalists (many of them Catholic) thinking that his rule was illegal. By getting the side of religion (the pope), he was able to appease them and legitimize his rule from detractors.  The "illegal treatment" does not refer to oppression, but his legitimacy to the crown.

But we get all this from dialogue and conjecture.  We can't actually play through the events, which you should be able to.  Those were just some of the immediate questions.  There could have been more, like brokering a deal with the batarians, hunting down people who have dealt with Collectors before, finding slavers, more failed research teams, etc.  The Reaper corpse had to be recent because it had the cuttlefish profile shared by the current generation of Reapers.  It begs another question:  How the fuck did they find this thing?

 No your attorney couldn't say that, but in reality no one can tell you to do that. They are legality required to report you if you make a claim that your going to do something illegal. But from what the OP said, the lawyer wasn't advising him he might have known the OP was going to skip bail but cases like those are hard to press because of Attorney client privileges. Whos gonna report him the person he helped? He was doing something illegal technically but its a hard case to prosecute and would never end up with him being arrested or losing his license. A lot of lawyers do this, unitentionally and intentionally.

Plenty of tabs have stroke directions, they are represented below as ^/v below. Wahs and Rests can easily be represented, and I am inclined to believe you are comparing poor tablature with good sheet music, While representing the key is not as common on tab, it could so easily be done by writing "A Minor" above, which would work fine.  Tablature is so much more flexible whereas notation can be so restrictive. In earlier periods of music where standard forms were more prominent (medievil, baroque, classical) I believe notation would rarely find it's limits, now almost every day I see notation with scrawls of hand written notes above it giving additional input, so many accidentals that it renders the key practically redundant, translations from Latin to English because, sorry to break it to you, practicality should override tradition and we do in fact, speak English nowadays.  Anyway that's just my 0.02c.

Not true. The pressures required to melt ice are immense. [WolframAlpha](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=melting+point+of+water+at+-5C) gives something in the order of thousands of atmospheres.   This is also the reason why ice skates are supposed to work, but again, the pressures are still too high for this explanation to be true.  If we model the sled as a simple mass on a surface, then the friction force is related only to the mass. (F=umg) Surface area or pressure does not affect the friction force. (See [Leemy's post](http://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/awgd3/scientists_explain_this_to_me_why_do_pulling_two/c0jr0w9)) Unless this is one of those tricky boundary conditions, which I don't think it is, but whatever...  My explanation is that it's harder simply because you have the added weight of one sled in the second scenario.

If you found out the reason for the headaches its unlikely going back to the doctor and telling him this information will do much. I doubt he would call for more test since your MRI came back fine.    Also never be afraid to tell a doctor your drug usage. Unless of course your trying to get a benzo script, then telling the doctor you have abused drugs in the past wont help your case. But really doctors arn't going to report you to a police station, they cant tell your parents.     They may ask you questions to scout if you have a problem but from your post it doesn't seem like you have to much a problem excluding the marijuana usage.

I typically spent in the 500 range per semester for books.  I hope you realize how lucky you are.

Thank you. I haven't yet figured out the specs, but I know he worked his ass off to build this PC for 2 years, constantly upgrading it.
See thats the thing.  Ive had plenty of gfs and none have complained about this.  I dated one for a few years, and she was a pretty cleanly lady.  This really hasnt affected my female interactions.

FTA: "There's not much any president can do outside the frame of what all others do."  Meaningless drivel. Sounds like an angry old man. Also, its an opinion piece that's short on facts.   downvoted.
You either have the discipline to take care of yourself or you don't.  The bottom line.  Actual thyroid disorders resulting in obesity are a TINY fraction of the overall population - you have a better chance of meeting a siamese twin with a gay brother and only one butthole (and you think *your* life is bad).  Depression is a copout.  Everyone is depressed - it's a shitty world out there!  Why do you think Avatar is quickly becoming the most profitable movie in cinema history?  **Escapism**.  You accuse me of being the one who needs to lose a few pounds (btw, I'm 5'11" and 190 lbs, I could actually stand to *gain* a few, just FYI), but you're coming off awfully defensive.   Makes one wonder.
NO!
What game type are you playing? I know ffa and use map settings don't register for points, but I think 1v1 and top vs bottom do.
Well, my Radeon fan has been driving me insane lately, and was loud out of the box, so I took both the good AND the bad advice: I sprayed air onto the bearings, then added a drop of light oil. Now it's whisper quiet.  (Sure I could buy a whole new fan, but you have to understand there are two kinds of people: Those that replace, and those that tinker with what they have until it's fixed or so thoroughly fucked they HAVE to replace it).
In some circles it might be considered polite to reference the original author, Jay Pinkerton.   http://www.jaypinkerton.com/backofthebible.html
I was unaware that having such a clearance was that valuable.  
In movies...you wander around peaceful in your robe and do crafts and no one much bothers you? Was it like that, like a gentle vacation?   Was it hard being around the other crazies? Did she make any friends?  What is it like for you dating someone with that many issues? Are you a caregiver by nature? Do you try and make like as easy for her as possible?
Also, why shouldn't customers be allowed to ask if they can modify an order?  They are paying for the food and should be allowed to have their food prepared a certain way (within reason.)
I agree, long story short I walked in on the part with the massive spiders and I was scared beyond belief.
Maybe you should spend less time on the internet and more time with your kid if she's drawing pictures of the logo of a website you frequent in an attempt to get your favor.         ... Just saying. 
I'm just saying that if there were documents I wanted to destroy (paper in filing cabinets, electronic files in computers) controlled arson is the way to go. Bribes might be paid, or a guard is tied up while alarms are disabled. Whoosh. You leave.  Could probably have it done for $75,000, and then have the arsonists whacked for that again. No one ever finds out.  You don't wait til Saudi terrorists crash a plane into the nearby building, and then dispatch the demolition team to blow it in 3 hours for a job that would take weeks.  I do not know how or why things happened as they did that day, and I'm not saying that nothing weird happened. But yours isn't any explanation at all.
No such thing as over-paid (at least in a free-market).  He makes around 1.4 million a year, runs a practice, pays massive taxes, and employs a lot of staff.   Are you joking though?  The difference between a Vet and a human MD is massive.
A point I was hoping to make is that the level of anger you're thinking of should be the baseline rage. Breaking a pencil during a test isn't rage. Rage is when you're throwing chairs across the room, threatening to kill internet search companies.
I would say there was, but there were never any fights over it or anything.  I think they pretty much just left the issues alone, or addressed them at board meetings.  I think they had a little respect for each other because of their common beliefs even if they didn't agree with some aspects of their lifestyles.   I think that most people that were there were at least bi sexual because so many of them were swingers.  The only people they didn't really accept were Trans-genders.  A few Trans-gender men came to the resort once, and they were not well received.  On the other hand there was a cross dressing guy that was there all the time, and everyone loved him.
Look, for everyone's sake could you please just shut the fuck up?   just do it for a little bit. We're trying to enjoy your daughter's drawing but you keep ruining this submission every time you type out a comment. Just chill the fuck out, have more confidence in yourself as a parent, stop typing out long winded pointless or straight up confrontational retorts to anyone that says anything you don't like and MAYBE we could remember that this submission was about a kid drawing the reddit alien and not the poor plight of kids these days born to uneducated parents.       in my mind, for some reason, i can just picture you reading this comment and screaming out *'WELL,I NEVER!!'*.
If you don't know what I mean, especially after putting quotation marks around "literature", then there's no point in arguing with you.  I don't consider something like The Stand (often listed amongst King's best, and certainly a favourite of mine) equivalent to say Midnight's Children, A Hundred Years of Solitude, The Grapes of Wrath, The Great Gatsby etc.  But hey... that's just my opinion.
I see them as just reflecting what music sells the most. Definitely not musical excellence. For example...Lil Wayne won a Grammy award. WTF?
That economic system that consistently fails in spectacular fashion?  I'm aware of it.
There is the horror movie where I think the kids were digging a hole or something in the backyard and it leads to hell or something.  Anyway this big ugly monster comes out of the hole after a series of other crazy monsters have come out and the kid kills it with his model rocket...  That movie scared me for years.
Why is that "too bad?"  That sounds like great news for the NFL and no news for the Champions League.  As stated by notlob, with the UCL final moved to Saturday, their numbers are likely to increase as well.
The accident report probably won't be available for another 24 hours.  I'm going to be talking to my insurance in the morning.  What should I expect the lawyer to be able to do for me after I have this information?

What about Coke Zero? Because that may be hard to give up ;)  And don't worry there is exercise in my diet, a cardio workout every day that burns about 450-500 calories (my elliptical says so!) But I certainly wouldn't want my blood sugar levels being all over the place.  Maybe the problem is more so the amount I eat because when I eat, *I eat*, know what I mean?  I probably shouldn't take advice from my crazy diet friend... although she certainly does look gorgeous.

Listen, I get your point. I'm basing my view on the views of the majority while openly admitting that this of course does not apply to everyone, that is not bigotry. It's not bigoted to say Italians like to eat pasta because if you are familiar with Italian cuisine, you know that is very apparent. That doesn't mean all Italians eat pasta, it's just a general statement. I know you won't get this, but try hard to read what I said and see if you can understand it.

I never liked Rand's POV that women are nothing but the whores of the most 'successful' men.
Secularism/non-religion is just as much religion as religion is. And the secular sect is just as willing to let their world be subject to illegal treatment as long as it's in the name of progress or science. We all come from different world views and we have to learn to stand for justice. As a Christin I am poised to things like homosexuality but I also believe that god gave us the free will choose how we live. Since marrige is a religius institution I don't support the us banning gay marrige. The congress can't make a law respecting that because it would be respecting a religious establishment. That is the law and I would want the same support from the secular world if the US tried to hinder my religion. Religios people need to see that is they don't respect the law for others then it will not be respected for them.
Haven't you heard of multi-tasking?

Ah, you seem to have problems understanding.  Comment searching does nothing to help you find relevant links.  Nothing you can say will change that.  If you would like to search all comments you need to start using "site:reddit.com" in your google searches and stop bitching at reddit for not being google.

Okay: Next question - Do you live in the middle of the woods? If you don't, are there a lot of broad-leaf trees (that is to say, not evergreen) nearby?  Edit: Aww heck. I won't keep you guys in suspense any more.   I am:  99% certain that this is a (damaged) caterpillar nest, and  75% certain that it is a Gypsy Moth Caterpillar nest. (most of virginia is smack-dab in gypsy moth central, and there aren't too many other "tenting" caterpillars in the appalachians other than the eastern Tent Caterpillar - see below)   If its not that, then I am  24% certain that it is a Eastern Tent Caterpillar, *Malacosoma americanum*  Now: I am NOT an Entomologist (so I could well be wrong here), but i have buddies who are. With your permission, Ill send this link to my bud who works as an agricultural extension agent for the state of North carolina. He deals with  pest species like this all the time.  
Hellen of Troy. Actually if she's as advertised, I'd probably only need 5 minutes. Wham, Bam, you can have her back, Priam.
"The iPad is a computer for people who don‚Äôt like computers."  The iPad requires a computer. When you pull one out of the box, the first thing you'll have to do is hook it up to iTunes on your PC. If you want music, video, or photos on your iPad, they have to be managed on your PC first - just like an iPod Touch. So why exactly is PC+iPad supposed to be easier than a PC?
ouch
Oh yeah, because in 40 years you won't overreact when some electronic devices show up in the shape of some stupid new kids movie character.  On second thought, you probably won't, because you'll still be living in your parent's basement in your XXXXL wolf moon tshirt, eagerly awaiting said movie.

My friend really wants to join but no one has given him any advice on what to do , to fix his credit. It would seem logical that getting a job and paying it back/making arrangements would seem more sensible than just filing for bankruptcy.   Morally, he doesn't want to sue his parents, they have no money it wouldn't do him any good
You should see her when she watches porn. But seriously I don't think I could stand being around her for longer than 5 min.

I never said I was a genius. It's stupid not to ask questions. Have they fully researched it? :)
First: It takes more talent than you (probably) have to make music like this.  Second: It's not always necessary to voice your opinions. Exercise restraint.  Third: I'll reiterate: It's ridiculous to say someone doesn't deserve to live because they like different music.  Fourth: I don't think you could be a bigger douche.
And do you ever feel unaccepted there? I ask this question especially wondering about women that _would_ be okay with trans-people but still end up feeling uncomfortable.
Uh, maybe you don't check reddit that often, because we don't like Fox News much!
&gt; How is a regulation that allows only one ISP in an area ensure competition?  Exactly. It doesn't. My point was that regulation is *supposed to* be in place to ensure competition. That is why I am hesitant to call the policies of an incompetent government that simply gives out regional monopolies to the private sector "regulation", at least in any useful sense. But, of course, all of this gets in the way of a cheap shot at the much feared "socialism".  Also, Soviet Russia was not "socialist" in any useful sense.  &gt; Are you a economics major?  God no.
Dammit! I had forgotten about that story. FFS man don't tempt someone to post it! I'm going to drown myself in booze now and hopefully forget this night ever happened.

&gt;How do you think everyone else who works out manages to eat healthy post workout rather than eating fast food?  The point of the link, article, and study is: THEY DON'T  People tend to think "I went to the gym today, I can splurge on that muffin" and they blow 2 days of gym calories off in one muffin.  Many people find the workout makes them helpless in line with the diet. You're trying to make blood glucose levels into a character flaw. It's not. It's science.

He's done a LOT for their cause and visibility if you think about it. My dad hates the guy because he went to military funerals with GOD HATES AMERICA and GOD HATES FAGS signs.  The enemy of my enemy is my friend. My dad can agree with gays that this Phelps guy is a dick... in my book that's progress. He's tolerant of gays because he has something to agree with them on.

Latent potential still has the potential to... be potential. Uploading them and destroying them is stupid, it's just as likely no one is downloading/readin what you put online. Put it online, but keep the books.  You don't always have to have everything be used all at once, sometime useful things are allowed to chill out.
Unfortunately in today's age of databases and such... there are plenty of reasons that I would not tell a doctor anything except what I thought was relavent to my problem unless I could work it out so that we were talking strictly "off the record".

Is religion a prerequisite for being poor?  Is religion a prerequisite for success or intelligence?  Of course not.  If there is a disconnection between religion and wealth, perhaps that stems from the arrogance of some who believe themselves to rule their own little world and see no need for an Almighty God to usurp their high position.     It seems that your continued use of the world dumb, stupid, and what not, is very hateful.  Perhaps my sensitivity is because I am watching a movie on mental retardation.  It just seems to be malicious on your part.    You say forget about America, but I haven't seen any hard statistics regarding the rest of the world and religion, so I can't really speak of that.
It is a dilemma, but a dilemma that simply must be accepted and dealt with.  I would say that if you feel comfortable enough to go out in public appearing as whatever gender you are trying to appear, then you shouldn't have any problems using the bathroom that people looking at you on the sidewalk would expect you to walk into. Just be discreet and don't attract unnecessary attention. Just blend in and walk around like you own the place, as if everything's normal. If you're all shifty eyed and nervous when you go to the bathroom, then people will pick up on those nonverbal cues and be suspicious.

I guess my main beef with him is that he says people are becoming less complacent with violence. That is, violence is more and more looked down upon. I suppose this is true in the West (Mind you, people still watch Jackass). The question is: Is it true for the rest of the world? Take note of the acid mutilation that was on reddit a while ago and the video of the man being burned alive in Africa (some religious thing).  Also his ill definition of violence. Sure we can look at death rates but what about things such as domestic violence and mutilation. 
Ranked as the [ninth](http://www.globalfirepower.com/country-military-strength-detail.asp?country_id=Japan) strongest military in the world.

You don't consider him among the greats of literature. But some of us do, and the fact that you disagree doesn't make you correct.
Yeah that whole comment was sarcasm free. While I personally do not agree with the war in Afghanistan, I do support the men and women that have risked their lives to keep other people safe. Yes the whole thing is a quagmire and far too many people have been killed thusfar, but the sacrifice that the individuals have made needs to be recognised none the less.

Oh man.  ok so there was this cult that used to come to our resort about once a year or so.  The leader lived in Texas and was loaded, and he had couples from all over the country meet him there for a week.  It was usually 3 or 4 couples.  It was the strangest thing ever.  They always found new ways to get themselves in trouble.    One day (middle of the day, broad daylight) they all order fruity drinks with extra fruit.  The girls are all sitting on the pool ledge, and the guys were in the pool.  They hid the fruit in their kooters, and the guys played a hide and seek contest.  
So it's true that you support elderly rape?
You could probably import them just as cheap, without running the risk of customs tearing your car apart.
Well, in their defense, if it's okay for a young boy to emulate machismo, there really isn't anything wrong with young girls pretending to be their gender's counterpart to that.  I'm not saying it didn't make me furrow my brow, but morally...eh, whatever.
Most hospitals no longer allow smoking, at least in the US. While she was there they still did though. People tend to smoke more out of boredom. Even with all the activities it is still a very boring place. The staff tries to get everybody to quit.

Yeah, it's more of a "funny, I didn't think Fred Phelps would actually bleed, let alone *blood*" sort of funny.

It makes sense that they're a suspect, of course, but suspect is not the same as guilty. If Hamas is to be taken seriously, they need to demonstrate a new trait: responsible restraint.

In contrast, I do know that I both enjoy and appreciate variety and choice in all aspects of my existence.

If you're into science at all I highly recommend [Cosmos](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0081846/), hosted and narrated by Carl Sagan. It is quite long, but definitely worth it.
This.
If you'd be interested int MotoGP motorcycle racing [Faster](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0368721/) is really cool. Narrated by Ewan McGregor, too.  Oh, and speaking of Ewan McGregor his documentary [The Long Way Round](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0403778/) is also really cool. Him and his buddy ride motorcycles from northern Scotland, through Europe, Mongolia, and Russia, hop a plane to Alaska, and ride down through Canada, across the US, and finally finish in New York City. Lots of really amazing scenery and cool encounters with people.
CLEARLY SO!
I think vicariously would have been a better choice but I upvoted anyway.
Somebody posted a link today to a recording of a family in a rental car with the accelerator stuck ... the car was up to 120 mph.  They called 911 but before the operator could suggest anything (too busy asking them their location, as if that was relevant), they crashed.  Sadly the driver was a transportation safety inspector, but he never thought to put the car in neutral.  Instead, he urged the other passengers to pray, which was ineffective.
I think it is great the way people protest the Westerboro Baptist Church. Yelling at them just gives them power. In the last couple of years WBC came to Silverton Oregon who elected a man who wears women's clothing (don't know the PC term for that). About 100 people all cross dressed and protested the protesters. It was a great day in Oregon and also very clever.
One of the shirts appears to advocate drunk driving. I stopped browsing after I saw that one. Do me a favor and kick your buddy in the nuts for me.  EDIT: It says "Drive fast and take chances, and there is a picture of car keys and beer".
I laughed out loud (in the supermarket queue: people stared) when I read the comment about Macmillan having a "monopoly" on the books they publish ... especially given the terms Amazon intend to impose on Kindle books. From [Charles Stross' blog](http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/2010/01/amazon-macmillan-an-outsiders.html):  &gt;you have to agree that Amazon is a publisher, license your rights to Amazon to publish through the Kindle platform, guarantee that you will not allow other ebook editions to sell for less than the Kindle price, and let Amazon set that price, with a ceiling of $9.99. In other words, Amazon choose how much to pay you, while using your books to undercut any possible rivals (including the paper editions you still sell).

This is awful.    One of my roommates worked at a homegoods store that was pretty poorly monitored.  No cameras trained on the registers, crap loss prevention measures, etc.  We found out that they also didn't check the daily register totals, like how much was rung up on that particular register for the day and how much was voided, and went to town.  We'd fill up a couple of carts with shit we wanted and took it to the register our roommate was at.  She'd ring us up, void out everything but a couple of small items, and we'd be out the door.  I think our final total was just under $8k worth of goods for the low price of about $50.
Mr Rogers already showed everybody what to put on their signs for a protest.  &gt; As an ordained Presbyterian minister, and a man of tremendous faith, Mister Rogers preached tolerance first. Whenever he was asked to castigate non-Christians or gays for their differing beliefs, he would instead face them and say, with sincerity, ‚ÄúGod loves you just the way you are.‚Äù Often this provoked ire from fundamentalists.

Hard drugs - anything from cocaine to heroin. I cannot tell my country of origin but it is in Europe. I went to the United States to work because I was quite competent in my field. That event was a massive life changer because obviously I was not going to work in that field again, once back in my country. I realized I did not like it so much, anyway. I live a completely different life now.
Tag ... Flag ... Wag ... Sag ... Drag ... ... ... none of these words will ever be pronounced as if they had an "e" on the end of them.    I'm the furthest thing there is from a grammar nazi but we need to nip this "vag" nonsense in the bud.  It's a very unappealing sounding word already but, if anything... go for "vaj" or "vage"  Anyhoo... people with compromised immune systems sometimes have to take drugs like diflucan for weeks or even months at a time and at higher doses as well so you'll be just fine with them for 3 days.

If you have the means, and can build a fire in your backyard or in your fireplace, put the pan in the open fire and cook everything off of it, then start from scratch.

While I certainly understand your sentiment, anyone enlisting in US military hoping to "keep other people safe" is an utter idiot. I can understand, although don't necessarily approve of, if they do it to receive a scholarship, pay the medical bills of their mother, travel around the world, beat up natives or whatever, but saving people? Heh... no. He should have become a fireman, rescue worker or, if he really needs a gun and obedient bystanders to play around with, a police officer. Soldiers are trained to kill and, in the case of United States, usually not the guys, who are threatening their fellow citizens in any way or manner. It's this bizarre idea that the Americans seem to have in their heads, probably caused by the nauseating ubiquity of patriotism, that always kills me a little bit inside. Keeping people safe? What a joke.
&gt;unspoken  You seem to have messed that one up...wouldn't it have been more, er, *fitting* to just downvote me into oblivion too? That said, thanks for the heads up.  So why don't we just quietly delete the three comments we've left? I'll delete this specific one after you delete yours....
&gt; the fact that you disagree doesn't make you correct.  I couldn't have put it better myself.  For what it's worth, I explained myself and provided specific examples of works that are generally considered "literature" (there's those pesky quotation marks again!).  So, either you're being deliberately disingenuous, or you know exactly what I mean and have a chip on your shoulder over the fact that a favourite popular author of horror stories (which ***he himself*** calls "the Big Mac and Fries" of books) isn't considered as "important" or "influential" as some of the Canon's Nobel Laureates.   I suspect the former, but I couldn't really give a shit either way.    I like Stephen King.  But he's no F Scott Fitzgerald mate.  Get over it.

I think that TF2 is one of the few multiplayer sequels that Valve has released that has really outperformed the original.  (Technically, neither Day of Defeat: Source or Counter-Strike: Source were full-on sequels; they were just ports to a new engine.)  Counter-Strike 1.6 is actually preferred to the new game by many high-level players (heck, CS 1.6 is still more popular than TF2), and you'll find apologists for Day of Defeat 1.3, but nobody really plays TFC anymore.  You're not missing out on much if you ever fire it up.  I would really only recommend TFC to people who enjoyed playing Quake.

So I am still correct, Cerberus was not apart of the Alliance in ME1? I don't see how you are helping yourself. Cerberus was originally part of the Alliance before the events of ME1 took place, in the game ME1 Cerberus is a separate splinter group that used to be apart of the Alliance, same story in ME2
I don't remember the name of the movie, but it was about this volcano erupting and this family trying to escape. I was fine with the whole movie, except one scene where they're on a boat trying to cross a pond and it starts boiling and they start sinking slowly. They make it almost to the dock but realize they are too heavy to make it so the grandma jumps out and tries to walk the rest of the way to shore in order to save everyone else on the boat. When she gets out her legs are all burned and messed up and they have to leave her behind (presumably to die slowly from either the magma or her wounds.)  I haven't seen the movie again but the idea of that scene still scares me.
I like dark humor fine, I guess I just don't like slapstick or physical comedy very much. Sure, I found some parts of Braindead funny, and the sheer amount of blood they used in that movie is comical, but I guess I feel like I'm not enjoying this as much as I'm "supposed" to? Maybe I should start smoking weed again...
I think it's referencing to the dangers of leaving your stoves on while leaving the home.
If you've ever listened to music while surfing the web, you are *using* two apps at the same time.
If I said that not washing for six months was a huge turn off, you could also say that's an absolute. The fact of the matter is that nearly all men don't want to see facial hair on their female partners. To be honest, I can't think of any reason why lesbians would either, except in a weird "girl power, fight the patriarchy, don't shave" kind of way.   It's amusing how sensitive women get when men say something broadly critical about the way women groom or dress themselves. I think you girls should learn to take a little of what you dish out!

Some relatively recent favorites of mine that I recommend to people who come into my video store are:  King of Kong - A man tries to set the new Donkey Kong high score and finds himself in an insane nerd sports movie.   Man On Wire - One of the highest scoring films on Rotten Tomatoes ever. It's about the french high wire artist who walked between the Twin Towers in the mid seventies.  John Pilger's The New Rulers of The World- It's a documentary about politics and power, using indonesia as a case study. Powerful stuff.  Capturing the friedmans - What started off as a documentary about a kids party clown turned into a statling film as accusations of Child Pornography are levelled at the clowns father.  
Mine TOO!!!   I leave and when I get back they are dead, WTF.  At least the hamster is immortal. 
For the past twenty years I have been frequently accused of being Harrison Ford, especially by strangers in bars. Also, I have been told that I look "exactly" like some guy who used to star in "Quantum Leap", which I have never seen. But all i ever wanted was to look like Paul Newman and I have never been able to convince anyone of that. FML.
In that case Debian running XMonad.  The little bar at the top is a program called dzen.  Without that it's just a black screen.  When I'm using a workspace it'll look like [this](http://i.imgur.com/t8CQ2.png).  That's an older shot without the bar at the top though.  I added the bar so I could see what workspace I was currently on and what workspaces had windows open.

I use 600-watt HPS. It's a lot easier to take an image then isolate, enhance and zoom to check for ripeness, rather then messing around with a loupe or whatever, if that's how you do it. I keep an eye on the oxidation of the pistils naked-eye, and usually get it right. I might have taken this one a couple of days early, but there's really a window of a couple of weeks of ripeness, and this plant was in it!
take oral probiotics that you find in the refridgerated area in the supplements dept at a health food store.  YOu can also insert the probiotic capsules vaginally at night every few days.  This will really help a lot.  Your system is being bombarded with medications, which could help, but also could still leave you at risk for further pH imbalances and irritation.  Another option too in the future is to alternate probiotics and a garlic clove at night for five nights in a row.  This helps A LOT.

Do you know what Nutella is? It is a hazelnut spread you can put on just about anything and make it taste delicious. Here is how to make it even better:  Spread the Nutella on some crackers, sprinkle some bud on top of the spread and make sandwiches out of them. Wrap them in tin foil. Preheat the oven to ~300 and cook those bitches for about fifteen minutes. Let cool, eat, and get high shortly thereafter :)

So you pretty much have everything you need. Try writing x and y in terms of h, I.E. manipulating those equations with cot you have a little bit and then putting those equations into the formula for d. If that doesn't help I can give you another hint.
I kind of think we'll evolve into two separate species. One which is intelligent as fuck and the other that is strong as fuck but dumb as a doornail. Kinda like in The Time Machine although I doubt they'd start feeding on one another.  But yeah by and large the stupid out-breed the intelligent.
That wouldn't be possible if English didn't get rid of its declension system.
I disagree.  For every thousand people challenging the received wisdom of evolution, 999 of them are receiving their wisdom from the bible.  Original thinkers are rare. 
Yep, it's true for me, too. Then again, I didn't start this thread by making unfounded assertions that I didn't back up.   I fully admit that I can be completely wrong, and most of my posts are just opinions.

I don't know, Westboro Baptist Church's existence makes a pretty strong argument for supporting gay rights, so I hope they stick around for a nice long time. I mean, for fucks sake, they wanted to protest Fiddler on the Roof. How does that even make sense? Here's hoping other people against LGBT rights look at them and go "Wait. We're on the same side? I may need to rethink my stance."
A rocket.

Yes it is derogatory.  It shows no respect for their position.  Their position is that abortion is killing a baby.  It isn't about choice for them.  It is about life or death.  You can certainly disagree with their position, but to denounce the position and degrade it to one of choice is your first step in turning them off.  The OP asked how to discuss the topic with people who are anti-abortion (which you ignored).  Just like the pro-abortion camp doesn't like to be called that, because they say it is about pro-choice.  I don't have a dog in this hunt.  I'm a married man and past all the concerns here.  But if you can't see that you are choosing the terms that suit YOUR POSITION and berating the terms that don't, then you aren't able to step back from the argument and see both sides.

I'm a sucker for heist films and "Rififi" is one of the very best. Practically every American or British caper film since the 70s has taken from Rififi.  "Le Cercle Rouge" and "Le Samourai" with Alain Delon are the embodiment of 70s cool. Steve McQueen had nothing on Alain Delon.

[L'invasion de Barbares](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0338135/).  Wonderful dialogue and original yet relatable characters.

You can't think of anything French without eventually hitting Michel Gondry.  It's part french and incredibly creative in a lot of the scenes.

The Meaning Of Liff, by Douglas Adams &amp; John Lloyd  
&gt;My point was that regulation is supposed to be in place to ensure competition.   But it doesn't. That's all that matters. Social Security was *supposed* to be sustainable until 2030. It isn't. The reality and outcomes are all that matter, not the idealism. Regulations rarely ensure competition, they discourage competition by setting up barriers and increasing the cost of entry.  &gt;Also, Soviet Russia was not "socialist" in any useful sense.  Once again, the same thing as above. It wasn't socialist in your idealistic Marxist sense, but in reality it was what socialism could manifest into.

I belive it was called "There go, The Orphans". The story of a group of jewish children who are hid by a bishop in France. Very moving. I'm not gonna spoil it but it was very moving. The dialogue was fucking excellent, the cinematography was good (not sure I like the film format because it seemed like it was 5% too fast.  Check it out tho!
you can do all that in the iPhone, iPod, and iPad.
Things like this are why I'm glad I live in SF and why I will never leave.    You just don't get that sort of counter-protest absurdity anywhere else.  Instead of a challenging and potentially violent response from people who are angry, you just get someone saying "hey, we're crazy too and we're more creative than you look at us instead!".    It works so much better than violence or actually protesting in general.  
Lots of people donkey vote, it's why being first on the ballot gives you a few extra percents of the votes. (From the people who just vote in the order the ballot is in).  All you need to do is sign off your name, and then you can just walk out.
Yeaahhhhh that may be jus' a lil' unnatural.

&gt;These guy's don't even really believe what they're saying.  I don't buy it. While I think there's validity to the legal angle, from the interviews and documentaries that looked into it there's no way they're not religious nutjobs. With the amount of kids, especially. Kids in general are just crappy actors, and even worse at improv. 
As a user you only need to know what's returned if there was an error. (Exceptions and runtime exceptions really make things a lot cleaner.) Of course mentioning this stuff wouldn't be necessary if it were standardized, but...  `strlen(NULL)` returns 0.  `ord(NULL)` returns 0.  `imlode(NULL)` emits a warning.  `ltrim(NULL)` returns an empty string.  Yea, that's really awesome indeed. I'm sure that there is at least one person *somewhere* to whom this behavior makes a whole lot of sense. Probably. :)

Do yourself a favor. PARTY DOWN. It's brilliantly casted with actors from the State, Freaks and Geeks and Christopher Guest movies. It's also written by Paul Rudd and directed by Fred Savage. Definitely the best comedy series I've seen in a long time.   http://www.sidereel.com/Party_Down  Premise-  The show follows a Los Angeles catering team, a sextet of aspiring Hollywood wannabe actors, writers and musicians stuck working for tips while hoping for their "big break." Each episode of this half-hour comedy finds the hapless catering team working a new event, and inevitably getting tangled up with the colorful guests and their absurd lives.

The seven deadly are mostly a catholic thing. They're much more oblique in the actual bible.   Wow. Well...I have know a shitload a Christians. Literal Shitload. And I have met a handful like you describe. They are considered to be, even in the church community, fucking nuts. Frightened Beady eyed autistics. Most Christians follow Christ more than all the other freaky little rules in the bible...and Chist was a big happy hippie (till that whole unfortunate crucifixion dealy) The most important thing is to act as Christ would have you. And Christ commanded eating, wine, kindness, pleasure and humility.   Have you studied much modern christianity? Probably not, if you hate it?  Thank you for having this discussion with me. I've always felt like a strange atheist and am constantly trying to figure out why I stand so alone in my position.

I'm seven years old and what is this?
Then what were they?
We can't prove there weren't any, but we have no evidence there were any either.  I do think we can say a technological civilization is highly unlikely, since that would leave obvious anomalies in the form of refined materials, fossils of structures and artifacts (even if they were just imprints), fossilized pollution, etc. To my knowledge we've never found anything like that, so we can probably just about rule out any intelligent technological civilization before this one. But we can't rule out dinosaurs with, say, very early stone age levels of societies.  If there's no evidence available, a proposal is arbitrary and is just speculation. It's kind of fun, but doesn't mean anything scientifically.  How sure are we there are no populated planets or moons in the Alpha Centauri system?

Yes, constantly actually. I think that's probably one of the keys to making it work. We have a lot in common, but still it would be foolish to ignore the obvious (I think). I made sure she was comfortable with those sorts of comments first of course, but having that freedom is nice, especially when you're curious about something that you might otherwise be nervous about asking.
I had a friend years ago that would pass out so completely that we could do anything to him and he would not wake up.  One night he passed out dead drunk, yet again, so we stripped him down to his boxers and put him out on the middle island of a busy street (Beach Blvd in Huntington Beach, for those familiar).  The next day, two cops showed up at my door with the guy in a blanket and asked if he belonged to us. They said it took them so long to get him to wake up that they were about to call an ambulance.  Note: I posted this same story on a thread about drunk people.
If the "small" problem is a source of the "big" problems then it ought be eliminated first, or you're only treating symptoms rather than the problem itself.
Is it the erection itself that's frowned upon? or is it displaying it like a trophy? Were the ones getting erections generally looked down at just for getting an erection? Does something similar apply to women getting particularly noticeably wet, as in you can smell it wet?
Why not just use bright flashing lights? Or a motor attached to your bed to make it vibrate violently? Or a canister directly above the sleeping person to drop water on them?
Favorite new character?  For me it was Thane. I really loved learning about his race. I'm really sad that he has that terminal illness. I thought his loyalty mission might have been going out to find him a cure or something, but I liked the actual one better. Still, I really hope in ME3 you can find a way to cure him.
No, they didnt make an entire linux distribution for this.  From the article: "The operating system is based on Ubuntu 9.10".  They just modified ubuntu with a new skin and released it as an ISO

&gt; It does not, by default, mean unfettered, destructive hedonism. But a moral atheist life, in terms of making responsible, self-critical decisions to maximize satisfaction and freedom for both the self and others will look functionally similar to a life "constrained" by the recommendations of orthodox Christianity.  So I should have no problems getting into heaven then?
Certainly religion is a symptom and not a cause, I just wanted to point out the sheer absurdity in the belief that god interacts on a tangible level. If he did indeed interact as the religious assert, he is doing a mighty shitty job of answering their prayers!

Patriotically despicable? Their roles in Iraq and Afghanistan have included supporting US armed forces in clandestine operations and protecting civilian employees foreign to the area. It seems you are still judging the character of many based on the actions of a few. What point have you made? All you've said is that you are indifferent to a horrible death these men might face. You have no idea what you are talking about. If you did you would never have brought up IEDs in such a way.
We definitely need more Jurassic Park material. Doesn't matter if it's a book, a movie, or a game, we just need more of it. There are so many possibilities for that literary world.  But anyway, I think a big problem with the premise here is that the dinosaurs aren't necessarily pursuing you, certainly not in the same way that zombies do. Sure, there are the carnivores, but even they won't hunt if they're not hungry. You've gotta have a reason for them to be after you.  I also think hiding would be a very important game mechanic, as well as door functionality.  I can think of a lot of cool scenes from the books and movies that would work great. I'd love to play the scene where they're riding on the motorcycle, being chased by raptors, ducking between the feet and tails of a herd of apatosaurs trying to defend themselves.

you obviously dont realize what you're saying so let me make it simple on you  first of all the universe is mindbogglingly huge, there has to be another earth-type planet suitable for us, probably even a relaxing smaller earth so that we weigh less and can play a bit better basketball  second, how do you say "we cant get rid of our problems by finding a new place" without first realizing that our place we live in now is in fact, full of problems?, and that finding a new place would actually be beneficial since our place apparently has so many problems? do you think before you speak?  you're one of those psuedo intellectual types who thinks he has a good bit of commentary on everything, i've looked at your posts, you fuckin flamer , thats what gets me riled up, the fact that douchetypes like you have so many posts on one of my favorite newsdiggs

When I was eight or so, I went on vacation to Kezar lake (where Stephen King lives I think). One night I stayed up way past my bedtime watching a movie, the title of which I have never really figured out. It was about these aliens that come and abduct several people in a small town, leaving only a group of junior high school students to save the world. The aliens had these copper plates they stuck into their heads or something, and these plates were integral to the plot of the movie. It's weird that that's pretty much the only bit of the movie I remember explicitly, but the impression of how scared it made me for a long time is still with me at 27.
Perhaps he means "natural" in the same sense that taxes are a "natural and inevitable" consequence of concentration of power in society in form of State.  Clearly a *substantial* effort has been made (for at least the past 100 years) to bring about this "inevitable" and "natural progression", with the latest efforts including defrauding the voters of "EU" ('lets try that again, shall we?') and using "DU" on the (less "progressive") "3rd world" people who are (apparently) behind the "natural" curve of "progress".

Pretty much any MMO would suffice your desire to play an online (best source of multiplayer) hack n' slash.  WoW would probably be the closest since it takes so many RPG elements from diablo.  Of course, I shouldn't encourage the playing of this game, because it is such a drug.  But if its blizzard gameplay, oblivion expansiveness, and online play, wow is the least common multiple of those things.

Any erection was frowned upon.  I don't think people were shunned because of it they were a little more mature than that.  They were also a generally older crowd so it wasn't that much of an issue.  As for the women, there usually wasn't a problem unless she was doing something about it.  
That race of dog looks damn ugly.
What netbooks cost less and provide more functionality at a lower price. My biggest problem with Apple has been their constant flow of average being pushed on us by brand loyalty. The list of devices like the Ipad that can multi task, can run whatever programs you want, and have standard input output devices. Ipod was the first quality hdd mp3 player that got publicity. This tablet is already worse then products already out and way to restrictive than their competitors.
I never understood why people don't realise the inside of the zipper head scratches the laptop's paint.  I had a laptop case, it was great apart from this problem.

I don't know if that would be fun though lol.
surely, if he hadn't, he would jump at the opportunity to deny such allegations; however, to my knowledge he's done no such thing.  it just confuses me so much.  i love my young girls from the '90s.. and i fear for them.
Thanks for giving me some context. I am unaware of a history of retired rugby players committing suicide though that doesn't mean of course that it doesn't happen, just that I've personally never heard of  brain damage / emotional problems being a risk for rugby players. Sudden athlete death yes. Occaisonal horrific spinal injury yes. Regular broken bones too. And from a very anecdotal perspective, the majority of retired rugby players I know are very articulate. (The rest I doubt could ever string two words together).  I know also that certainly in youth rugby, if a player is concussed, he is not permitted to play for 2 weeks.   Also the only rugby player with whom I have ever had a discussion on the subject of head injury, said that the one time he had concussion  was caused by a post match injury - he drunkenly walked into a swing door. 
I don't know what's going on there (I'm not all that computer savvy) but that is awesome to look at.
Wow.....this is one of my new favorite comments ever. Iv been saying this for a long time. Ultimately, it's not about a patriarchy or a feminist conspiracy, It's about out of date gender roles, and the older people in power (judges, senators, etc) who are quick to defend and live by them.

This penalty is no where near harsh enough.  He was caught on multiple cameras biting the ball to a point it needed to be replaced, he pleaded guilty, clearly had the intention of giving his team an advantage, and he doesn't even miss out on a proper match.  Two Twenty20 matches is an insult to every other player in the world that somehow manages not to bite/alter the ball during play.
By the way, I'm not looking for your pity.  I'm looking for your curiosity.  It seems to me, when I read around, people complain about some petty things in human relationships.  They don't have as many dozens of friends as someone else.  They haven't gotten laid in a whole week.  They lose focus on what it means to have a friend in someone.  They don't seem like they can even fathom a world without that person, and take it for granted.

&gt;I don't care that the App Store is a closed system. I can jailbreak for myself and I think the closed system works better for most users.  The problem is that that still leaves you at the whim of Apple. If they want to break your iPad they can. If they don't want to they still might., albeit on accident. People can't write their own apps for it; they have to go through the app store.

With all due respect, I find that hard to believe. The riff that comes in at around 0:20 are quarter notes played at 210 BPM. That riff alt. picked is cake, but trying to play it with just down-picks (as Metallica does) can prove to be difficult.
Are you trying to get at the universe just being a result of evolutionary (non Darwinian) process? I don't get how your pi example is relevant. You seem to put forward that notion that mathematics is *discovered* rather than *adapted* to match observed phenomena. Remember, Mathematics is just a language *developed by humans*.   You seem to be touching on rejecting the anthropomorphic view of the universe. People tend to think that the universe is *special* because it houses life such as our own. The fact that we exist means that there exists a universe that we can exist in. If we consider Brane theory, then it is possible the universes exist with different fundamental forces. If they do exist, then it makes sense to think of it as an evolutionary process in which a universe that can host life as we know it has arisen. This universe is likely no more special than any other universe, when considered at the scale of multiple universes.   Sorry if I missed the point of your post.
Apparently not. I posted this and then looked to make sure the link worked properly and BAM! I saw it: "Tiranny".   I said "Oh boy, reddit's gonna be on that like shit on velcro."

That brings up another point.  If you did the KKK thing with "God hates niggers" would you get arrested/sued?  Surely fag is equivalent to nigger in harmfulness?  If they ever stop by my town, I'll call around to see what I can do.  Seeing a hood really wouldn't be too surprising where I live.

They are anti choice *because* they believe that abortion is "killing a baby", but that doesn't mean that the term "pro life" is appropriate. Saying somebody is "anti choice" isn't rude..it's a fact. They disagree with giving woman a choice to opt out of pregnancy. It's not treating them unfairly at all. Saying someone is pro life however, implies that they value life, and pro-choicers don't. It twists the concept a little. It would be like calling pro choicers "pro women" instead of "pro choice".   I always found that "pro life" was a way to discredit the other side of the debate with sensationalism. Pro/anti choice is more equal. Calling somebody anti choice isn't about a lack of respect. It's simply the most neutral.  
Not to be a jerk, but do you think you deserved time in jail for your actions? How do you justify the path you chose? Do you think that your "stupid mistake" didn't deserve to be punished? Surely if you were facing such a long time in prison, it wasn't a single mistake and it most certainly wasn't a small one.  e: Oh jeez did I upset reddit by asking the OP valid questions? Maybe he shouldn't do an AMA if he expected everyone to support what he did.

Even better, IMO, was the 2000 article ["Visiting Gore Calls Pennsylvania 'A Hell Hole.'"](http://www.theonion.com/content/news/visiting_gore_calls_pennsylvania_a)  It's brilliant every bit of the way through.  'Later in the day, Gore made an appearance at the Johnstown Agriculture Fair, at which he served as judge in the Sorghum Queen pageant. The vice-president was overheard making numerous inflammatory comments off-microphone, including, "Get these bitches out of here" and, "This is someone's idea of an attractive woman?" One contestant, attempting to present Gore with a bushel of Pennsylvania apples, was reportedly waved aside with the words, "No. No fucking way."'
Could you figure out the bass line for No You Girls by Franz Ferdinand?
In Canada we say "fuck off" in an endearing way, as if to say "I don't believe you, you're crazy!"  I've been told Americans only say it in the harsh, angry way.  This isn't exactly what you wanted, but I find it interesting.
Well I really can't speak for Americans as I am Canadian, so I will still hold onto my perspective when it comes to our soldiers.
I highly suggest you start reading the entire history of Israel starting with 1890 to present. While there's history before this that is of note as well, the 1890 forward really gives you some context as to why Israel and Israelis can *never* be trusted on any level or recognized as legitimate or peaceful. The more you know about Israel and its history, the more you understand that being a gentleman to a pig is how a pig fucks you in the ass. While people with no context observing the conflict today consider the wrong side or both side pigs the reality of the struggle is far different than what your lying television has sold you.  To play by the rules is not how you win against Israel, that's how you get deceived by them.  http://www.jafi.org.il/education/jafi75/timeline.html  http://www.palestineremembered.com/Acre/Palestine-Remembered/Story725.html

&gt;second, how do you say "we cant get rid of our problems by finding a new place" without first realizing that our place we live in now is in fact, full of problems?, and that finding a new place would actually be beneficial since our place apparently has so many problems? do you think before you speak?  unless you think we'll be colonizing the galaxy within the next hundred years or so....no, "jumping ship" is absolutely not a viable option at this point. We'll have widespread disease/starvation/poverty long before then unless we put forth adequate thought and resources toward maintaining a sustainable existence on Earth.  and i'm glad you've taken the time to look at my comments. feel free to respond to the posts you've found to your disliking.  i can't say that i've taken the time to scour your post history, but from what i'm seeing here i think you could also use a bit of improvement.

The reason that there are U.S. soldiers in Japan is because the last time there weren't, they went out and invaded half of Asia, massacred millions, and enslaved thousands.  As someone who grew up in a city that still bore the scars of their occupation 50 years after they were kicked out, I think they can go fuck themselves.     
I follow you.  Do what it takes to keep yourself safe.  VMware will generate additional MAC addresses for network connections.  Another idea (instead of grub) would be to load Virtualbox...but it is still somewhat flakey.  It works with DHCP as well.  Good luck...

&gt;&gt;This is measurable according to the biblical teachings that as a child of 12, Jesus met with doctors who were amazed at his ability to converse on advanced concepts.  &gt;This is not in the bible. Not sure which ass he's pulling this out of.  I'm by no means defending this person, since I do not believe in the bible. But the author is probably referring to the time when Joseph and Mary lost Jesus while travelling in a great city, and they found him in a temple discussing God with the priests. Can someone provide book and chapter to back me up?
Ohh so the US might possibly do something bad to China? Why is alright when China preemptively invades a country out of fear that those in it might do something bad to them but not when the US does it?   &gt; Kinda makes sense that China got involved.  So does the US going into Iraq make sense as well because proximity really doesn't mean much in to days world...the US claimed it believed those in Iraq would do harm to them if they didn't strike first. Either both invasions are justified or neither are. 
We would tell a manager if it seemed to be a problem.  erections weren't allowed so most people would just cover them up if they got one on accident.  I would never report someone if I thought it was an accident, but if they were being pervy we could get them kicked out.    This one time there was an old old man who came into our restaurant with a huge boner, he must have had 2 or 3 blue helpers, and it was probably the only one he was getting that year.  Well, it seemed he was just trying to get away from the crowds and calm down, so I left him alone, but one of my friends got pissy about it and called the manager over who told him he had to cover it up.  The old man got really defensive and he shouted "My arm's hard do I have to cover that up too?" Hysterical.  
i wouldn't have the balls to put my touch it if i were him.
Yes!
You can watch all 5 seasons for free on Hulu (or various other places).  I only *just* started watching it this year. I ignored it the entire time it was on, because the early advertising made it seem like a different show.  Then, when I would occasionally see part of an episode while channel surfing, I had no idea what was going on.  Then one day, I randomly decided to give it a chance and started watching it from the beginning and I was completely hooked. I watched all 5 seasons over the course of a few days, pretty much non-stop.   You have to watch it from the beginning, and it really rewards you for paying attention. Also it helps a lot if you get all the references, homages, and in-jokes they throw in. 
That looks like a series of cheap shots to me... if this weapon has any basis in physical reality, all of those maneuvers should have destroyed it.

I could be wrong, but posts don't really hit 1000+ unless they're in subreddits everyone subscribes to anyway.  If someone is unsubscribed from a subreddit like AMA or Funny, it's not because they're not aware of it, but because they don't want to see AMA posts.  I just feel like this might not be the most useful feature.

I don't know how you could disagree with my definition. It's pretty standard. There are different degrees of liberty and enslavement. For example, a slave on a plantation who is allowed to leave and do whatever he wants for 3 hours a day is more of a slave and has less liberty that a slave on a plantation who is allowed to leave and do whatever he wants for 6 hours a day.
It's so much more fun with someone else.
I installed Linux and Firefox on their computer.
And there is a *disagreement* here on whether the government is the source of all of those problems. Libertarians assert that, but somehow fail to show me the stable admirable society with no government. Where is the society that solved the problems of bigotry and poverty without resorting to government actions?

&gt;So all palestinians are terrorists?  Certainly not my conclusion. I don't know if that is how you feel.  &gt;Any way you put it, killing another person is BAD!   Really? Do you reject all self-defense? Or is it only bad if Israelis do it and not if Palestinians do it?   &gt;Shooting pregnant women to kill both the mother and the baby is BAD. Seems like eveything the Isralis do is BAD!  So all Israelis are terrorists? 
Okay: Next question - Do you live in the middle of the woods? If you don't, are there a lot of broad-leaf trees (that is to say, not evergreen) nearby?  Edit: Aww heck.

(most of virginia is smack-dab in gypsy moth central, and there aren't too many other "tenting" caterpillars in the appalachians other than the eastern Tent Caterpillar - see below)   If its not that, then I am  24% certain that it is a Eastern Tent Caterpillar, *Malacosoma americanum*  Now: I am NOT an Entomologist (so I could well be wrong here), but i have buddies who are.

Physicist here: If you were pulling the two sleds such that the ropes were not parallel to the direction of motion (sleds touching side-by-side), then it requires *more* force to overcome friction than if the rope is straight, as in the one-sled case.  This is why carrying a shopping bag that has bulky contents seems heavier: because the handles are not hanging vertically and only part of the force you are exerting goes into pulling the sled or the shopping bag. **Edit:** [pic](http://imgur.com/xX2w7)
Natural selection is an iterative algorithm that occurs on timescales difficult to grasp with human brains.  I think people have a problem with algorithms (and want an outright explaination, not a description of a process) and can't grasp the concept of "millions of years"
This penalty is no where near harsh enough.  He was caught on multiple cameras biting the ball to a point it needed to be replaced, he pleaded guilty, clearly had the intention of giving his team an advantage, and he doesn't even miss out on a proper match.

By the way, I'm not looking for your pity.  I'm looking for your curiosity.  It seems to me, when I read around, people complain about some petty things in human relationships.  They don't have as many dozens of friends as someone else.  They haven't gotten laid in a whole week.  They lose focus on what it means to have a friend in someone.  They don't seem like they can even fathom a world without that person, and take it for granted.

Hamas as an organization purposefully target civilians and they are by no means angels either. Freedom fighter? No. Both sides are wrong here. He probably had it coming as he probably ordered the deaths of many innocents himself. On the same token if someone poisoned the Israeli PM he'd have it coming too.   Picking sides in a fight in the muck is foolish at best. Hamas are terrorists and the Israeli are genocidal imperialists.   Both of them have noble goals. One is to finally retake their homeland and the other is to fight against oppression. But they're both using dirty tactics.   So you sir, snap out of it because you're supporting terrorists. 
Dude, watching people getting hacked to death with machetes isn't funny.  Edit: Thanks for the downvotes sadists. 
I liked the way you irrupted/disrupted the grammatical other into the (re)reader's (re)flected "self"-consciousness via the jarring (re)present-ation of the superficially inappropriate existential "it's" for the conventionally anticipated possessive "its". For is its "it's", its *it is*, if not its "its" of other possessing other? What, to the other is its being if it's unpossessed? It's its "it's", its *being* other, its *it is* that it is/has in its "its". Being is possession; possession being, and in the otherness of possession is also its unbeing, its (it's?) *other-than-being*.

I love how they quote Matt. 19:5 in support of their anti-gay beliefs. Whenever you see Bible quotes cited like that, look them up. Usually the self-professed Christians are either leading you on or don't have a clue what they're referencing.  tl;dr: [Matt. 19:5 actually is part of a reply to a question that representatives of the establishment asked Jesus in order to entrap him. That question was whether a man can divorce his wife.](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2019:3-12&amp;version=KJV) If Jesus' reply to that question is evidence of Jesus being anti-gay, then talking politics at /r/politics has to count as proof that one hates programming.   Actually, it's less of a huge stretch to extrapolate a pro-gay attitude from Matt. 19:11-12 than it is to extrapolate an anti-gay attitude from Matt. 19:5.  The more I look at things, the more I realize that Christians frequently don't know jack shit about Christianity.

I got a similar one.  I was about 13, got a dartboard for christmas.  It was later that morning, the dust had cleared from the frantic gift unwrapping and I got the dart board out.  I set it on the floor leaning up against the fireplace hearth.  scooted back across the room and was leaned up against a chair.  I was probably 8 feet away.  I had never thrown a dart in my life.  I threw the first one and hit a bullseye.  I threw the second one and I swear it hit the exact point where the tail on the first dart comes together but has a small gap.  the second dart was hanging out of the back of the first dart.  My dad was right there.  I showed it to him.  He didn't even care. :(
Dude you need to read the Phantom Tollbooth.

A lot of the cost is that it is highly specialized training, so you need to pay for teachers who could make a lot of money actually practicing in their field rather than teaching. Also the materials for learning are not cheap at all. There is some very expensive equipment people need to be trained on, corpses to dissect are not cheap, etc.  Another factor, IMO, is to keep idealism to a minimum. No matter how idealistic you were when you started, by the time you can actually practice on your own, you have a quarter million in debt to worry about, so you can't just go off to a third world country and work for free, or help out poor people, or whatever you initially wanted to do. I see the same factor in a few other fields, notably law.

CErtainly for his buddies it makes perfect businnes sense.  &gt;sound financial decisions, etc etc.  that brought our country to finansial collapse, yet we are the ones bailng out the banks and loosing our houses.  &gt;Conservative personalities are just better suited to other fields.  I wonder what conservative personalities like Rush Limbaugh, Hannity, Glenn Beck, Bill O'Reilly, Ann Coulter and may many others are doing (and quite successfully) in show businness ?  Well let's cut the bullshit and say it as it is. Conservatives are perfectly fine in show businness. It's just they have nothing to ridicule, because if they try to find something they'll end up looking in the mirror.

I was training for triathlon during the time when I tried Plyo the first time... I only made it to about 45 minutes in before I gave up too.  I stuck with it though and the 3rd time I was able to finish it.  I think that it's a sign that it's a good workout.    Also, if any of the stuff is too much for you, just take a rest break for a bit and jump back in when your heart rate is back in a good zone.  The fact that you weren't able to finish every exercise is great in my opinion, because it gives you something to work towards!

First of how is that site determining what to rank.  It seems to me they are incorporating far more than just military might but economic and manpower as well.  Bogus source in my opinion as I can't even find their methodology, you should go beyond a simple google search next time.  As for technology, China is very much on par with Japan when it comes to current military technology. China also has more of the modern equipment while Japan still has some rather old technology filling out their ranks.  They certainty have the means to easily out match China technologically, but that is why China does not want Japan to fully rearm.     Just compare the air forces of the two countries.  With the size and advances being made technologically, China clearly dominates Japan.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan_Air_Self-Defense_Force#Aircraft_inventory  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People's_Liberation_Army_Air_Force#Aircraft_Inventory

We definitely need more Jurassic Park material. Doesn't matter if it's a book, a movie, or a game, we just need more of it. There are so many possibilities for that literary world.  But anyway, I think a big problem with the premise here is that the dinosaurs aren't necessarily pursuing you, certainly not in the same way that zombies do. Sure, there are the carnivores, but even they won't hunt if they're not hungry. You've gotta have a reason for them to be after you.  I also think hiding would be a very important game mechanic, as well as door functionality.  I can think of a lot of cool scenes from the books and movies that would work great. I'd love to play the scene where they're riding on the motorcycle, being chased by raptors, ducking between the feet and tails of a herd of apatosaurs trying to defend themselves.

Interesting. I used to think that jsoverson's answer was correct and in fact, I remember doing the math for the ice skater example in my thermodynamics class and it working out all right. I might try redoing it later. However, after playing a bit with WolframAlpha I found that it gives 0.002573¬∫C as the temperature needed to melt water at 1atm but it gives 6120atm as the pressure needed to melt water at 0.002573¬∫C which is, at the very least, inconsistent.  [Wolfram](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=melting+point+of+water+at+1atm) [Alpha](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=melting+point+of+water+at+0.002573+C)   This inconsistency seems to disappear for your -5¬∫C example so the problem might be with working to close to that near vertical line.

The wages of people on minimum wage will go down, the wages of the unemployed and interns will go up.  Most of this cancels out, but the overall amount of wages provided will rise, because the overall productivity is rising (because of all those newly employed people.) Also, these people will now be meeting people, getting job experience, using less government resources, and staying out of trouble, so lots of resources that used to be spent on them get redirected to good, productive activities.
yes, but it's exactly that type of thinking that will hinder change.   Be the change you want to see in the world. According to your logic, if everybody took that advice and paid with cash, then the situation would fix itself.
Is this something we are meant to see as serious and tragic? Cause if so that is the most unintentionally hilarious storyline ever.

I love how they quote Matt. 19:5 in support of their anti-gay beliefs. Whenever you see Bible quotes cited like that, look them up. Usually the self-professed Christians are either leading you on or don't have a clue what they're referencing.  tl;dr: [Matt. 19:5 actually is part of a reply to a question that representatives of the establishment asked Jesus in order to entrap him. That question was whether a man can divorce his wife.](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2019:3-12&amp;version=KJV) If Jesus' reply to that question is evidence of Jesus being anti-gay, then talking politics at /r/politics has to count as proof that one hates programming.   Actually, it's less of a huge stretch to extrapolate a pro-gay attitude from Matt. 19:11-12 than it is to extrapolate an anti-gay attitude from Matt. 19:5.  The more I look at things, the more I realize that Christians frequently don't know jack shit about Christianity.

i don't think it's that people are pro-whaling.  i think it's more a matter of not forcing your cultural norms onto others.  it would be like telling the rural people in Switzerland to stop making dog jerky and dog sausage when it's a tradition.  yes, there are international limits set on how many and which whales you can kill.  as far as i know, japan abides by it and the demand for whale meat is actually pretty low. 
I'm still not sure what you mean by a 1-(spatial, say)dimensional reality.  What I would _imagine_ you would mean by that is "a collection of events that occur along a line in space."  If that's the case, you could describe anything's position along that line (as a function of time, maybe) by one coordinate-- and the sum total of the events constitutes reality.  Is this what you mean?

The very existence of the "vicitms" you feign empathy for is because of the power of capitalism to produce far more than any other system.  Without it, most of them would have starved long ago.

With further study of the phase diagram, you can really understand how amazing water is.  Off the top of my head, water is the only one that has the line separating liquid and solid tilting to the left.  That means that it's the only thing that will liquify if adequate pressure is applied.  It's because ice is actually less dense than water.  When you add pressure, the crystal lattice structure of ice collapses, it becomes water.  The density thing is nifty, and it's why ice floats.  Since ice floats, life in water persists.    /streamofconsciousness

The film was *Breaker Morant.*  Two thumbs up.  I'd seen it before and he hadn't, so I was glad to be able to answer questions on the spot.

&gt; That doesn't mean we just accept them   Yes, it does. Until you accept them, there's nothing you can possibly do to minimize them. Without acceptance, you can't think rationally about this. Without rationality, you're blindly going after a tiny target and have no way of even knowing when you hit it.  For instance... what if we told ourselves to quit fucking caring about wealth inequality, and instead tried to do something about the minimum? Does it matter if Bill Gates has $40 billion, if there isn't a family in this entire nation that has less than the equivalent of $40,000 a year in income?  I would prefer that, myself. Do you?  If you do, then the next question is, how might we get there...

Good explanation, and it only leaves out the inflationary effect.  To explain that, you have to talk about who benefits from the minimum wage.  Unions have negotiated for contracts which will automatically increase pay rates based on minimum wage.  People may be making 10%, 100% or 500% over minimum wage.  So, when the minimum wages goes up, a lot of people's pay rates go up proportionately, causing employers to raise prices.  Competitive forces will cause general prices to rise.  Then the question arises who is hurt by inflation?  People living on fixed incomes.
And then it will get big and eat you.

Well well, are we not the lucky duck of the day. That looks delicious. Hash is safe, probably more safe than regular smoking (unless it's cheap/cut with something, probably not if it came from a shop?) because there is no plant matter (also shouldn't go bad because of this) Only a small pinch should get you where you need to go. As for method, hot knifes are always fun, if not a piece with a screen also works.  Where are you from?

1-dimension is nothing but a point. And, anything between two points would be...a line. Time is nothing but motion. The construction of the geometry of a point, or a line, mathematically, does not require time. To construct a point or a line in 3-dimensional, Euclidean, space, of course, [does].

I had a friend years ago that would pass out so completely that we could do anything to him and he would not wake up.  One night he passed out dead drunk, yet again, so we stripped him down to his boxers and put him out on the middle island of a busy street (Beach Blvd in Huntington Beach, for those familiar).  The next day, two cops showed up at my door with the guy in a blanket and asked if he belonged to us. They said it took them so long to get him to wake up that they were about to call an ambulance.  Note: I posted this same story on a thread about drunk people.

No, I didn't see the additional content.  I'm not being disingenuous, and I don't have a chip on my shoulder. *In my opinion*, he's an undervalued author who's written books that compare favorably to those of the literary greats. I spent four years in college reading Fitzgerald and analyzing the heck out of Hemingway. And‚Äîhere's that sticky phrase again‚Äîmy opinion is that King's characters are more true to life and vibrant than most. His characterization is wonderful.   He does some things poorly. He has a tendency to rush his endings and to go for pathos (and *deus ex machina*) over substance. But I disagree that his flaws override his strengths, and I do not feel that a writer's genre should be taken into consideration when judging his talent.  I don't care whether he's considered either important or influential even a tiny little bit.

With further study of the phase diagram, you can really understand how amazing water is.  Off the top of my head, water is the only one that has the line separating liquid and solid tilting to the left.  That means that it's the only thing that will liquify if adequate pressure is applied.  It's because ice is actually less dense than water.  When you add pressure, the crystal lattice structure of ice collapses, it becomes water.  The density thing is nifty, and it's why ice floats.  Since ice floats, life in water persists.    /streamofconsciousness

I don't know, Westboro Baptist Church's existence makes a pretty strong argument for supporting gay rights, so I hope they stick around for a nice long time.

I may need to rethink my stance."

&gt;Bogus source in my opinion as I can't even find their methodology, you should go beyond a simple google search next time.   I stuck to a simple Google search for a simple reason:  the source I submitted is pretty much in line with any other mainstream source you could care to provide.  Feel free to conduct your own search:  you will find that Japan is usually placed near the bottom of the top ten military powers in the world.  &gt;China is very much on par with Japan when it comes to current military technology.  The bulk of China's military is, frankly, obsolete.  While they have been busy modernizing their forces, the fact remains that only a small core of China's military has been brought up to current standards.  &gt;China clearly dominates Japan  Not quite yet, but definitely in the near future as China continues to modernize its forces.  Regardless, saying that Japan does not have a significant military in its own right is downright wrong.

I grew up in a small town, so I have no other real world systems to compare it to, but with that being said...  Currently.. in my experience it's amazing and seldom lets me down. Only issue I've noticed is that the way the train system is setup now, when something goes wrong it *really* goes wrong. A couple weeks back there was a 'medical emergency' on the track, this threw the Vancouver downtown core into chaos as we all had to leave the train system and find a new way home.  Luckily those types of issues are rare.

We definitely need more Jurassic Park material. Doesn't matter if it's a book, a movie, or a game, we just need more of it. There are so many possibilities for that literary world.  But anyway, I think a big problem with the premise here is that the dinosaurs aren't necessarily pursuing you, certainly not in the same way that zombies do. Sure, there are the carnivores, but even they won't hunt if they're not hungry. You've gotta have a reason for them to be after you.  I also think hiding would be a very important game mechanic, as well as door functionality.  I can think of a lot of cool scenes from the books and movies that would work great. I'd love to play the scene where they're riding on the motorcycle, being chased by raptors, ducking between the feet and tails of a herd of apatosaurs trying to defend themselves.

Seriously, I don't think there's anything wrong with you.  Now, I would, if you were doing things that were unhealthy or mentally unstable but from what you've stated it doesn't appear that way.  If Asian women make you happy, pursue it.  My cousin lives in Singapore and has met all different kinds of girls, yet he won't "date" any others except Japanese girls.  Dude, whatever in life makes you happy, as long as it's not hurting you or someone else; be happy.  Too many couples/people stick to the stigmata's of life that they forget to make themselves happy.  Cheers!
The only time I've ever felt unaccepted was at the place I worked when I went full time. Everyone there knew me as a man and a lot of people had difficulty adjusting to me as a woman. Several women even complained about having to deal with a MAN in the bathroom. (Side note - six months later, the biggest complainer and person who pretended I didn't exist ended up working with me on a project and getting along with me pretty well.)  At my current workplace, where they've only ever known me as a transwoman there have been absolutely no problems with the restroom. And when I'm out somewhere the breasts and makeup give people enough of a pause that they don't say anything.

If they are getting paid to be there (when I taught k-5 level math the inmates got 15 cents an hour to go to class) then don't be afraid to not pay them if they won't do anything.  The international students will generally be your most responsive (Jamaicans, Latin Americans, etc). White students will generally be the worst. (they are just as dumb as everyone else, but are often are convinced of their genetic superiority)  Absolutely don't break the rules. If you break the rules for an inmate, they can use it against you in the future. A student offered me $2600 to bring in a package for him. No thanks, as this would have forced me into bringing in the next package.  When I taught in prison I had 50 students between two classes, and one day when I gave them unlabeled maps of the US, only three of them were able to identify any states, and those were NY, CA &amp; Florida. You are dealing with people who have had a very different life than you.

I guess I think that cities and such would still show up in the geologic record after millions of years.

You are severely downplaying how modern Chinas military has become.  It is not the 1990s anymore.  Anyway, Japans actually military capability, right now is rather limited.  But if it wanted it could easily become a dominate, wide ranging force.  That is is the issue at hand.  China does not want Japan to fully militarize, because it knows it could instantly be a major threat.  But as it stands right now Japans military is not suited for anything other than defensive action.

I'm a Red fan myself. I like the parallel story lines in it and it all wrapping together in the end.
It's weird.  I had never even heard about this show until I stumbled across some DVDs at a Best Buy last time I was in the US.  I like DeVito, but didn't want to buy it because I'd never heard anything about it.  Worth checking out?
One experience was wierd. I went in for suicide ideation, and was there for about a week when I blacked out. They were trying to get a good sliding scale for my type 1 diabetes. Anyways I blacked out for 2 whole days. Not sure why, if it was the pills I was getting, or If I was in a hypoglycemic episode.    It was wierd I came to in the middle of the day watching TV and was freaking out because I had no memory of the last two days.. Didn't want to tell them I basically blacked out so I never did find out the cause of it. They told me I was stripping in front of every and doing all sorts of wierd things. Anyways spent another week there before they would discharge me.
Eat it!
WHAT......and it worked? impressive.

I'm guessing you've never watched the wire or lost? I've never seen deadwood but I wanna check it out.   ...   My favorites are (in order) LOST -&gt; the wire -&gt; battlestar galactica(going through the series now but it's damn good.).  There are many more but others have been mentioned or I'm sure will be. 
I'm going to share another awesome UAV tactic:  It's the perfect weapon to take down the apache and the black hawk. Just **ram** the enemy helicopter, fly under or above it and push it up/down (apparently the UAV weighs enough to push the big choppers around, who knew?) 99% of the time this will cause the enemy to crash into the ground, and it won't even damage the UAV.  Also it's fucking hilarious.
Personally, I like Foobar. It's small, light on resources, simple, and it's not bloated with crap like most other audio programs. Check it out, you might like it.
I'm very different in that I don't think much of death.  People seem to freak out whenever someone dies, and I can't figure out why.  I'm not religious, but I've accepted that everyone is going to die, including me.  It's just a fact.  My wife, son, parents, brothers, sister, friends, loved ones, neighbors, etc are all going to die.  What really boggles me is when a person who truly believes in a god breaks down over a loved one's death.  If I believed that my loved one is now in a better place with our savior, I'd rejoice.  Everyone I know gets very depressed, sometimes for a very long time.

Why would you want to use credit cards for everyday purchases? Isn't bank cards used? I mean, the only rational reason to use a credit card is if you really need to buy something that you can't afford at the moment. For everything else, paying money to be able to spend money would just be stupid.

I've never heard of anyone caring about a possible time/space trade off for dynamic vs static linking. It's usually matter of memory usage, modularity, dependency hell, ease of distribution... Any novelty there might be comes from the fact that GHC couldn't create dynamic executables before.

This has come up twice now and obviously needs some clarification: I said conservatives *value* work ethic, business sense, and sound financial decisions, not that they always *adhere to those values.*  &gt; I wonder what conservative personalities like Rush Limbaugh, Hannity, Glenn Beck, Bill O'Reilly, Ann Coulter and may many others are doing (and quite successfully) in show businness ?  They're in show business (well, all of them except Ann Coulter, who's an author with several TV appearances), yes, but none of the people you mentioned are particularly creative, now are they? Limbaugh's only real creative endeavor is finding a way to be more obnoxious every day.... And in fact that statement applies to all of them. Their only artistic contribution is reaffirming the conservative worldview.

HBO had a series called "Rome" that was pretty damn good. They show it on repeat every so often. I heard they canceled it after only 2 seasons due to the production costs. Too bad.

That's the garbage from mass media and still upheld pseudo-victorian traditions being washed away, and it's not a few weeks, but a couple hours.  Also, as a small aside, don't use the expression "nudist colony" in front of a nudist. Most nudists hate it. It's an archaic expression from the times of hippies and the like. Use the correct expressions like beaches, resorts and the like.

I wouldn't really consider Brazil obscure. 1st, any serious Monty Python Fan has seen most all of Terry Gilliam's work, and that's a huge # of people. 2nd, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas gained a lot of traction with the under 30 crowd who weren't steeped in Monty Python growing up, and a lot have discovered Gilliam's earlier works because of it. That aside, Brazil is one of my 10 favorite films of all time, along with City of Lost Children... and you'd be surprised by how many females I've met who both know about and love that film.  I think Synechdoche, New York was in netflix's top 100 rentals for quite some time, so again, not so obscure. (It has since fallen out of the top 100)  A good list of must see films though, I commend your taste.

&gt;Are you basically desensitized to nudity now?  Yeah, pretty much. I am a massage therapist now, and i worked in the spa at the resort for a few months, so I think it has helped me a lot with dealing with nudity.   &gt;What percentage of the nudists are hot?  Maybe 10-15%?  &gt;Do you get boners at hot nudists?  I've never had a boner = (  &gt;Do you get turned on by a naked woman still? Or do you need more in terms of emotional stimulation?  Well, for starters I am a girl, but I think working there made me appreciate the female form more, and it also made me feel super hot comparatively speaking.   
well, it hurts definitely if things are far gone.  just know it's a nice first step when you feel things starting to getting out of balance again.  :)  good luck - sad coochies are no fun.

What on earth are you even talking about?  All that "Open Source" means is that the information in question is available to the public.  "Closed source" would imply actual espionage.

Selective source makes no sense in the context of this discussion.

I was at a bus stop and this guy was hitting on me, and I was trying to be polite but at the same time somewhat firm in my refusal and then for some reason he asked me when my birthday is.

I didn't believe him, so he showed me his drivers license and yep it was October 20th.  My real birthday is June 23rd.  What are the chances lol.

When I was 12 or 13 some friends and I were accosted by some idiots with a pellet gun. Being that we recognized it as a pellet gun some of us stood up to them and they decided to walk (run) away. At some point one of them turned around and fired the pellet gun at us. At the first shot I swung my hand up in front of my face to block the pellet. After the commotion I noticed there was a pellet stuck in my watch. It was definitely dumb luck. This was almost 20 years ago and I came across the watch the other day. I doubt it meets the OP's requirement for f-ed up or unbelievable but I milked it for all it was worth with my friends.
I'd imagine that these women did this repeatedly. Would you guys deal with them the same way that you'd deal with men? When confronted, were they apologetic or defensive?

Just making sure :-) You don't want to die and have someone find you like that. 
Yes! I think I screamed when I first saw that. The movie itself wasn't frightening to me in general, but the way that scene was shot, it was very shocking. [Here it is](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QU6OsYUycSY#t=2m0s)

You heard right.  It was a joint production with the BBC.  After two seasons, the BBC wouldn't pony up their share ($50M!) for a third season, and HBO were not willing to pay for it all themselves, due to lacklustre returns.  They destroyed the sets.  I heard that HBO subsequently regretted their decision, as it has become very popular on DVD and has sold well internationally.
Yeah, I know they're out there. So...... agree?
Wow, ok this one gets a story too.  It was a holiday weekend and there were a ton of people around.  We had 4 cocktail waitresses poolside which was a lot and we all had to share one computer.  We were talking amongst ourselves after one rotation of collecting orders, and we all saw the same boner.  We were to busy to do anything about it, so we let it slide for a while and forgot about it.  Literally two hours later I walk by the same guy again, and I realize its not his boner, thats just how he is flaccid.  Then I realized that all the people around him were girls and there were like 10 of them.  It was insane.  I have never seen a bigger schlong.  It had to have been bigger than my wrist and at least 9/10 inches and this was flaccid.  He realized I was staring in disbelief and gave me a big smile.  
i did this in 2001.  it was harder than when i quit smoking the same year.    one of the best things i ever did on my road to happiness.  congratulations.

Actually yes you do.. Mac OS will do a good job of not getting fragmented if you are only doing simple little things like surfing the web, moving pictures off your camera, reading emails, etc..  But if you are doing more then that, working with large files.. Capturing video, downloading things from Bittorrent, etc then it would definitely help to defrag the system every now and then.  For optimization I would check out Cocktail, and for defrag I would check out iDefrag. 
Physicist here: If you were pulling the two sleds such that the ropes were not parallel to the direction of motion (sleds touching side-by-side), then it requires *more* force to overcome friction than if the rope is straight, as in the one-sled case.  This is why carrying a shopping bag that has bulky contents seems heavier: because the handles are not hanging vertically and only part of the force you are exerting goes into pulling the sled or the shopping bag. **Edit:** [pic](http://imgur.com/xX2w7)

Okay: Next question - Do you live in the middle of the woods? If you don't, are there a lot of broad-leaf trees (that is to say, not evergreen) nearby?  Edit: Aww heck. I won't keep you guys in suspense any more.   I am:  99% certain that this is a (damaged) caterpillar nest, and  75% certain that it is a Gypsy Moth Caterpillar nest. (most of virginia is smack-dab in gypsy moth central, and there aren't too many other "tenting" caterpillars in the appalachians other than the eastern Tent Caterpillar - see below)   If its not that, then I am  24% certain that it is a Eastern Tent Caterpillar, *Malacosoma americanum*  Now: I am NOT an Entomologist (so I could well be wrong here), but i have buddies who are. With your permission, Ill send this link to my bud who works as an agricultural extension agent for the state of North carolina. He deals with  pest species like this all the time.  
Go into your start menu, go to run, then type cmd and enter. Once you are in there just specify the path to that shortcut and type "del INSERTPATHHERE" (make sure there is a space between del and the path). Once you have done that it will say Y/N just type Y and hit enter.  If you need the path to the shortcut just right click on it, go to properties and copy and paste the path (you can't CTRL + V in cmd prompt so just right click and hit paste instead)

I lived in Boston for a while. I once had this story relayed to me: "So I pulled into the packie store when I see this hobo caressing the bubbler outside. I gave him a few cents and said, 'Hey, go have a wicked pissah on me!'"  * Packie store - Liquor store * Bubbler - Water fountain * Wicked pissah - Awesome time  Edit: Also, they go with "jimmies" for chocolate sprinkles, and just "sprinkles" for rainbow sprinkles. This has always bothered me.

As shown here   http://www.cheesemaking.com/store/pg/124.html  You must use milk that isn't ultra-pasteurized. It is harder than it seems in that all the milk that I have found at my local grocery stores are UP. Anyone have any tips? The article says she used raw milk, but that seems easier said than done for me. Where is it that I am not obviously looking?

&gt; i don't really know if /r/christianity is a circle jerk because it seems they keep to themselves and i wasn't auto subscribed.  So *that's* what this is about!  Your precious sensibilities were offended because you came to a web site that contains a large majority of atheists, and then were surprised when their stories appeared on the front page.  So, what's stopping you from unsubscribing?  My guess: you're waiting for a priest to come and stick his penis in your mouth and give you directions.

&gt;Are you basically desensitized to nudity now?  Yeah, pretty much. I am a massage therapist now, and i worked in the spa at the resort for a few months, so I think it has helped me a lot with dealing with nudity.   &gt;What percentage of the nudists are hot?  Maybe 10-15%?  &gt;Do you get boners at hot nudists?  I've never had a boner = (  &gt;Do you get turned on by a naked woman still? Or do you need more in terms of emotional stimulation?  Well, for starters I am a girl, but I think working there made me appreciate the female form more, and it also made me feel super hot comparatively speaking.   
Ah, a detail I thoughtlessly neglected.  I live in Brooklyn.  I've edited my post as well.  I know of a few stores that have a wide array of beers so I'll make a note of all the beers you mentioned.  Lots of bars around here have Sierra Nevada on tap.  It's not really my thing but I find myself ordering it from time to time anyway.  It's like I like it enough to always want to give it a second chance.  Which reminds me, it's about due for another try, haha.
I have no idea what you're talking about. The only diff i see is the Sydney Reddit logo (which is cool).  Otherwise it looks identical to all other sub-reddits  [edit] actually it does look a bit more streamlined.. looks fine to me.

I guess you're a small shop then, if you don't have a full-time IT guy or even an outsourced one, which is manageable without an enterprise infrastructure. That's not the impression I got from your thread, and I was probably too hasty in blowing up, but there's been this huge move in the sysadmin community lately towards force-feeding OSS down enterprise throats without regard to the detriment it may cause to usability and productivity, and I'm getting pretty tired of listening to those people rant and rave about the merits of software freedom while ignoring their users. I lumped you in with that crowd. I can swallow my pride and admit that was the wrong thing to do, and I'm sorry.

That'd be awesome if he got it. The description he once gave of how he'd like to end his life was amazingly touching. Nobody should have to be forced to make a decision between slowly losing your mind and becoming a  shell of the person you once were, or dying alone and scared with nobody able to be present.

I'd just like to point out you are full of shit. The 1967 border thru Jerusalem was simply the front line between the Arab and Israeli forces on the day the ceasefire of the 1948 war went into effect. there is nothing legal, planned or historical about it - the partition plan that created Israel intended Jerusalem to have a separate status as an international city under UN administration. Jordan controlled East Jerusalem and the entire Old City 1948-1967 (in fact they annexed it to be a permanent part of Jordan and gave everyone citizenship).   Please refer me to a legal document/ruling or a UN resolution that states that the parts of Jerusalem under Jordanian control till 1967 (including the Temple Mount and Jewish Quarter of the Old City) belongs TO A PALESTINIAN STATE.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positions_on_Jerusalem
Physicist here: If you were pulling the two sleds such that the ropes were not parallel to the direction of motion (sleds touching side-by-side), then it requires *more* force to overcome friction than if the rope is straight, as in the one-sled case.  This is why carrying a shopping bag that has bulky contents seems heavier: because the handles are not hanging vertically and only part of the force you are exerting goes into pulling the sled or the shopping bag. **Edit:** [pic](http://imgur.com/xX2w7)

I live in Toronto - and the ONLY time I've seen the tip added to the bill is in certain places when there are 8 or more people.  I was shocked to see the tip on this bill for 2 people.  I hope the star is by the waiter/waitress, because even people who live in Toronto wouldn't expect this.  The phone number is for a "Pickle Barrel" in North York, which is a very built up dense area.  Pickle Barrel is not high end, but it's not a fast food joint either.  There's a Pickle Barrel in my neighbourhood, I never go there.  A few times in 10 years and that was with others from work.  I guess I should pay attention to the bill if I ever do.

But isn't the very act of manufacturing plastic tying up carbon?  Making more plastic is using up carbon but NOT releasing it into the atmosphere.  And I know for a fact that if I buy a piece of wood, a tree gets cut down, the forest regenerates (absorbing more carbon), and the net effect is that an amount of carbon equal to the wood is sequestered.  If I buy a plastic bottle or a piece of wood and keep it in my basement for 100 years, that carbon is not going into the atmosphere.

6 months of wedging.   The transaxle is from a later year Porsche 944 Turbo (951).  It can handle the torque (HP keeps you there, torque is what you feel).  I had to replace the 951 transaxle 5th gear with the 944 5th gear to make for some good "overdrive" gearing for the highway.

I think the problem would be with brain sizes. A lot of dinosaurs just don't have high enough ratios to reach a comparable level of intelligence with us.  Also, I think that looking back we see that it was drawing and writing that really  helped spawn civilization along with vocal communication. The transmission and networking of information is one of the most important parts of any civilization. Without opposable thumbs that would have made things even more difficult.  So even on speculation alone it would be fairly difficult to argue that dinosaurs could have had any civilization at all. * puts on tin foil hat * On the other hand, the aliens may have not left any signs of the presence behind...

Your post is far wide of the point, which is this: It ought to be a personal choice, and as long as it can be shown it's what the person really wants (no coercion), then it should be allowed regardless of whether others agree or think it's "stupid".  No one's forcing you to choose suicide. Your personal beliefs shouldn't be forced on them.

[L'invasion de Barbares](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0338135/).  Wonderful dialogue and original yet relatable characters.  The ending is one of the best endings I've seen in any movie period.  [La science des r√™ves](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0354899/).  You can't think of anything French without eventually hitting Michel Gondry.  It's part french and incredibly creative in a lot of the scenes.  It's a pretty good anti-love story as well.  Also, Les Cousins Dangereux (sorry couldn't resist).

They do have flashing light alarms/notifications, but that won't likely help if you are asleep.

I don't know, 20 years ago I had a 1200 baud modem and spent several hours downloading a 1.44mb file from a local BBS, while tying up my phone line.  My grandfather had to dial an operator and say "Pennsylvania 6-5000" to call my grandmother on the phone.  My great-great-great...grandfather had to wait weeks or months for letters from his European relatives.    At a moment's notice, I can watch a video from across the planet of a complete stranger's cat doing silly cat stuff.    Sure there may be faster broadband in other countries, and sure new media will require faster and faster speeds in the future, but at the moment I can't complain much.    I think the disparity between two nations' broadband speeds would have to be pretty enormous for it to have any real effect on economic or cultural competitiveness.

Hamas as an organization purposefully target civilians and they are by no means angels either. Freedom fighter? No. Both sides are wrong here. He probably had it coming as he probably ordered the deaths of many innocents himself. On the same token if someone poisoned the Israeli PM he'd have it coming too.   Picking sides in a fight in the muck is foolish at best. Hamas are terrorists and the Israeli are genocidal imperialists.   Both of them have noble goals. One is to finally retake their homeland and the other is to fight against oppression. But they're both using dirty tactics.   So you sir, snap out of it because you're supporting terrorists.

&gt;I don't care that the App Store is a closed system. I can jailbreak for myself and I think the closed system works better for most users.  The problem is that that still leaves you at the whim of Apple. If they want to break your iPad they can. If they don't want to they still might., albeit on accident. People can't write their own apps for it; they have to go through the app store.
That is one cluttered system tray.

I started reading Nausea one weekend last year, and it began describing things that I had always felt but never been able to articulate.

Things like this are why I'm glad I live in SF and why I will never leave.    You just don't get that sort of counter-protest absurdity anywhere else.  Instead of a challenging and potentially violent response from people who are angry, you just get someone saying "hey, we're crazy too and we're more creative than you look at us instead!".    It works so much better than violence or actually protesting in general.

I answered your questions in my [AMA](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/awgfw/i_worked_at_a_nudist_resort_for_2_years_ama/)
You're good at your typing.
Yup, I understand, but lets look at what Ubuntu did. They ran a [poll](http://www.surveymonkey.com/s/GFVQP62) for proprietary applications that Ubuntu users wanted on GNU/Linux. I can understand Adobe Photoshop and even Skype being on that list, but poor software like iTunes, which doesn't respect user's rights, shouldn't be anywhere in the GNU/Linux circle. A lot of Windows and Mac users use these applications, because there are no alternatives available. However, when you step into the GNU/Linux world you do have options, numerous options, and we should be promoting that. In a sense promoting the culture of GNU/Linux where we have flexibility, user rights, fair use, and general freedoms that empower the user.  The way Ubuntu seems to mimic Windows &amp; Mac could lead it to become another Linspire. That would be very disappointing.
My brothers are spectacular at catching grapes with their mouth. On several occasions I've personally watched one of them toss a grape over our two story house and have the other catch it. Also, there were three complete tosses, coordinated via cell phones, from a minivan to a convertible moving at 65 mph on the freeway. There was a suburban between the cars.

I tried running in them for about a month, starting with short distances (half mile) and working my way up to 6 miles. Two days after that 6 mile run I ran 2 miles and my ankle started to hurt so I stopped. Turned out to be a stress fracture which took over a month to heal.   I guess I was doing something wrong, but I never figured out what. I may give it another go when it warms up and take some videos to work on my stride and foot falls. I've also heard that running barefoot builds good technique, so maybe I'll do that first for a while.

If they say that they are both questioning the same thing *and* that one is right and one is wrong, you have to assume that they are giving different reasons.  In the case of this article, they're actually talking about 2 different things, so it's a moot point.  Galileo questioned geocentricism and got it right.  Others are questioning evolution and getting it wrong.  All the OP is saying is that not everyone is Galileo.

This has come up twice now and obviously needs some clarification: I said conservatives *value* work ethic, business sense, and sound financial decisions, not that they always *adhere to those values.*  &gt; I wonder what conservative personalities like Rush Limbaugh, Hannity, Glenn Beck, Bill O'Reilly, Ann Coulter and may many others are doing (and quite successfully) in show businness ?  They're in show business (well, all of them except Ann Coulter, who's an author with several TV appearances), yes, but none of the people you mentioned are particularly creative, now are they? Limbaugh's only real creative endeavor is finding a way to be more obnoxious every day.... And in fact that statement applies to all of them. Their only artistic contribution is reaffirming the conservative worldview.

Not to be a jerk, but do you think you deserved time in jail for your actions? How do you justify the path you chose? Do you think that your "stupid mistake" didn't deserve to be punished? Surely if you were facing such a long time in prison, it wasn't a single mistake and it most certainly wasn't a small one.  e: Oh jeez did I upset reddit by asking the OP valid questions? Maybe he shouldn't do an AMA if he expected everyone to support what he did.

By "no friends", do you mean people who you feel that you can bond with, or just that you haven't even made casual acquaintances?  I can believe if you feel that you don't have anyone you can talk to since I sometimes feel this way despite having a few groups of people who I'd call friends... but to not even have someone you could hang out with just to pass time... that's both hard to really believe and saddening.

This is interesting, I have a friend who is going through something very similar. Her father divorced her mother, who was arrested for the sale of heroin when my friend was just born. So my friend was taken in by her mother's strict Islamic grandmother (mother's mother) and her mother's older brother. They told her that her mom had died just after childbirth and that was the end of it. Two weeks ago they told her that her mother was getting out of prison in August and that she really has a mother.  So I have a couple of questions:  Did your family and mother cover it up or was it just never brought up?  Was it a huge deal to discover this for you or would it have been any different if you had found out she was...abroad or something during that time?

I got a similar one.  I was about 13, got a dartboard for christmas.  It was later that morning, the dust had cleared from the frantic gift unwrapping and I got the dart board out.  I set it on the floor leaning up against the fireplace hearth.  scooted back across the room and was leaned up against a chair.  I was probably 8 feet away.  I had never thrown a dart in my life.  I threw the first one and hit a bullseye.  I threw the second one and I swear it hit the exact point where the tail on the first dart comes together but has a small gap.  the second dart was hanging out of the back of the first dart.  My dad was right there.  I showed it to him.  He didn't even care. :(

The screen needs to support stylus input. Using my fingers is great and all, but there is a lot of potential for allowing a pen-like input. Note taking and drawing are just the most obvious. You could get away with it on the Iphone because its screen is almost too small for practical stylus use but that expansive Ipad screen is just begging for a pen.

I had to laugh when I found this, because it is so many years later...my friend used to find random shit like this in his pockets all the *time*. Even after coming home from the airport. Which was scary, but funny. We had a bit of a falling out, which I'm bummed about, otherwise I'd call him about this. He's still in Germany, I think.

&gt; Just an under average guy   No person is under average.  Everybody is different, but to think that you are "less than" other people is a misconception you should fix.  Maybe someone (your mom?) told you that, and maybe you're not tall or something, but don't hang that stuff on you -- you're just ignoring the stuff that makes you neat and cool and special.    You may think a smaller penis is "under average" but for women who like it that way because it hurts them less, it's "perfect".  
No, I'm really not. I honestly want to see how the OP answers these questions. I don't know why anyone wouldn't expect it, his entire AMA is about him getting away with a crime! Are these not valid questions to ask?

This doesn't make sense to me at all... (1) this doesn't match my experience, as holding shopping bag handles at say a 80¬∞ angle to vertical does not make them seem 5 times heavier (2) the horizontal force components in the ropes cancel out at the point at which they are tied together and (3) conservation of energy demands that the work done by your hands as you are raising the shopping bags from the ground equals the potential energy gained by the bags, which, since your hands and the bags are moving the same distance, requires that the forces be equal also.  Your argument and equation illustrates the case where there are pulleys directly in front of (but not attached to or touching) each bag / sled, keeping the ropes parallel to the direction of motion on the bag-side, and transferring the force at an angle to your hands.  In this case, the distance (and therefore force) traveled by your hands vs. the bags is indeed different.

&gt;It means you can shape your comments for gaining points.  I suppose I *couldI*, but I don't.  &gt;I'm allowed to say this as a blind assumption, if I'm granted the same freedom you had in assuming I only delete comments when I am disagreed with.  I didn't assume that you *only* delete comments when you're disagreed with.  I assumed that you deleted *this specific comment* because you were disagreed with.  I based that assumption on the fact that you *said* that's why you deleted your post: "I have deleted my post due to a downvote avalanche caused by your bitching."  &gt;It was technically the same thing someone else said.  I guess I'll have to take your word for it, since the comment is no longer there for me to see.  Oh, and I would have upvoted your comment, but I no longer have that opportunity.
He mentions conversations geared toward "returning the favor," so I'd go with yes.
Also, just had a thought, since it's obvious that people are having trouble grasping the whole "switch the car off if it has turned into an out of control death machine" thing, I wonder if there'd be any value in vehicle manufacturers installing an "emergency stop" button? This would be especially valuable in the fully-electronic drive-by-wire type vehicles where the accelerator and gear controls have no physical connection to the running gear.
God forbid you do any of your own research before continuing to debate the topic.  http://business.maktoob.com/20090000428270/Top_Hamas_official_poisoned_in_Dubai_reports/Article.htm  This is a criminal investigation. I wouldn't be surprised if they intentionally do not mention the poison to aid in the investigation.   If someone doesn't know the methods used to kill him exactly, they can't pose successfully as someone that has information.   The current theory is his room was stormed by a group of up to seven men, a rag held to his mouth that may have been the delivery mechanism of the poison, and possibly electrocuted as well.
Well, the tax would have to be 14%, but I know what you mean, and that's a good point.  Combine tax with some rounding down ("$30" may really mean "$32.95" or something), and that could come out to over $80.
That looks like a series of cheap shots to me... if this weapon has any basis in physical reality, all of those maneuvers should have destroyed it.

Nope, you're good.  It hasn't been asked.  Most people had beach bags that they would put all their things in.  We also had an internal credit system members could utilize if they wanted to so they could go cash free, and just get a bill at the end of the month. Members also got 10% off of food.

Haha my girlfriend and I progressed from oral first onto sex afterwards.  Your best bet would be to offer to go down on her first, and don't just do this because you want reciprocation, it's quite fun. Still it does give you an opportunity to ask for one.  Don't pressure her into giving you a blowjob though since ultimately, it's up to her.  Also, even if your girlfriend was sexually abused when she was young, the fact that you two have been together so many years and have sex means that she trusts you and probably wouldn't have a problem asking.  However, if you want to be a chicken, then get drunk or pretend to, ask her then, and blame it on the alcohol. I hear that's what skanks do 
Black people tend to assume that if they don't get their way, it has to do with their race.

OK, I said they quote Sitchin but what I should say is that they often quote the same thing and that Sitchin says it first... which suggests they have the same script perhaps. Or that they are indeed quoting the other.

The majority of comments are in agreement that it is a problem, but why?  I know I drink too much and a blackout occasionally.  I have to drink just short of a handle if I want to get sloppy, two steelies to get at the proper goofy, enjoyable drunk, but 6 beers is doesn't do much besides calories, warmth, and relaxation. Yeah, I'm an alchy and it can affect the third leg if consumption is too high (the ole whiskey dick), but why should he be held to your standards?  Don't get me wrong, it doesn't seem to affect anything from the description you provided, so let him continue. If he became aggressive, hostile, depressed, unable to respond, then it's a different story. Yeah, preventative measures can ensure that it is avoided, but I bet if confronted, he won't care or will be filled with empty actions.  Threats won't be taken well, from my experience, it'll just end it disinterest.      I ramble, but it's not your decision to make, it's his.
I used to be of the "common sense" school of thought, but I think that's irresponsible advice.  If you browse with adblock enabled and javascript turned off, without adobe reader, flash, java, etc. installed and never download **anything**, then you're probably fine.  Short of that, it's only a matter of time before you get some funk on your computer.  Even if you only go to reputable sites, you're still putting a lot of faith in the sites, their developers, their advertisers, your network, and so on.  Don't tempt fate.  I'd recommend Avast, but I'm going to check out MSE for myself.  No AV product is perfect, but would you recommend against using condoms because they have the statistically insignificant chance of bursting?

&gt; I don't care if you're in excruciating pain every moment of every day. It's better than not existing.  I could not disagree more. Don't get me wrong, if pain doesn't scare you and death does, go nuts and keep on living through that pain. But for me, the value of life is basically determined as follows: Plot happiness vs. time. Take the integral under the curve. And although predicting the future is difficult, if I ever get to the point where I think the remaining value of that integral is going to be negative, I'm the fuck out of here.  &gt; That's worth living for, one short span of sheer happiness, every once in a while.  It can be, but only if it's more significant than the pain in between.

You stated your mother's situation ended up in the establishment of programs to help pregnant women in prison.  Can you please elaborate because I am very curious.  Is it even legal for the prison to pressure women to abort their child?  You said the other inmates were beating your mother.  Was that because she was pregnant and wouldn't get an abortion?  Anything else you know relating to this issue would be great to know as well.  Thanks!
what is your problem, man? chill out.
So you moved far? Outside of school, were you ill-received in your new neighborhood, or were there no neighbors to be-friend? What about middle-school/high-school, nothing 'friendly' existed there?
No I don't, I would love to more often, but I never find time (this has nothing to do with me being busy or not, more so just lazy).  It's not difficult, you can be up one of our mountains in the thick of the wilderness in about a 45 minute drive. With that being said I'm sure there is something closer that could emulate the wilderness, that I'm not aware of.

There was little enough bigotry in 1680s Pennsylvania, which, seeing as they basically told Penn he could go fuck himself with his regulations, was pretty much anarchic. Juries were always half-Indian.  I can't speak to poverty, but the only way relative poverty will be eliminated is by reducing humanity to a primitive hunter-gatherer society. Poverty, like wealth, is relative.  The only source I have on the Pennsylvanian anarchy is "Conceived in Liberty," by Murray Rothbard.

Considering that the history of Europe is in great part the history of the world, we have much to be ashamed of, but much to be proud of as well.
women are still paid less than men for the same job so their are some inequalities that need to be dealt with and education is a great place to do ir. and even if at New Trier affirmative action gets skewed, at my school (south side of Chicago 95% black 80% free lunch) it is hugley important and allows alot of smart people who never would have other wise been able to go to college go to college. their parents didnt have that opportunity(for the most part). parental education level has huge impact on student test scores. lower education of parents = worse results on test scores. the national poverty rate for black people is 25 % for hispancis 23 % for white people 9 % so the need is much greater. (im white and jewish). i agree that in an ideal world scholarships would be based on income and not race but that can only happen when we even out the income disparity. 
My wife and I would like to move there as well. This chart has cemented my decision. Are there a lot of French speakers by any chance? My wife's native language is French and it'd be cool to be in an area of the US that actually has some French speakers and culture (I know it has a decent Franco-American population).
We learned about that kind of kitchen in Food, Nutrition, and Wellness class. They called them "U Shaped Kitchens". I hated that class.

Regulations help the powerful minority exploit the majority. I believe the NY Times ran an article [citation needed] about Mattel and other large manufacturers who pushed for more safety regulationsand quality tests after the lead paint scare. This would have put a large burden on small toy manufacturers, like artisans who handcraft toys.
&gt;Are you basically desensitized to nudity now?  Yeah, pretty much. I am a massage therapist now, and i worked in the spa at the resort for a few months, so I think it has helped me a lot with dealing with nudity.   &gt;What percentage of the nudists are hot?  Maybe 10-15%?  &gt;Do you get boners at hot nudists?  I've never had a boner = (  &gt;Do you get turned on by a naked woman still? Or do you need more in terms of emotional stimulation?  Well, for starters I am a girl, but I think working there made me appreciate the female form more, and it also made me feel super hot comparatively speaking.

When you say a plateau, do you mean in terms of building muscle? Because if so, starving yourself is not going to help.  Also, if you do decide to do this, I would advise not doing a complete fast, but rather reducing the number of calories you eat on those day... by a high percentage if you must, but don't not eat anything.

Physicist here: If you were pulling the two sleds such that the ropes were not parallel to the direction of motion (sleds touching side-by-side), then it requires *more* force to overcome friction than if the rope is straight, as in the one-sled case.  This is why carrying a shopping bag that has bulky contents seems heavier: because the handles are not hanging vertically and only part of the force you are exerting goes into pulling the sled or the shopping bag. **Edit:** [pic](http://imgur.com/xX2w7)
Methodological naturalism means by default rejecting the supernatural as a regular, reliable causal component in observed phenomenal patterns. This is an underpinning principle on which science is based. In other words, the supernatural is denied in a certain way, in certain contexts.

I don't know, Westboro Baptist Church's existence makes a pretty strong argument for supporting gay rights, so I hope they stick around for a nice long time. I mean, for fucks sake, they wanted to protest Fiddler on the Roof. How does that even make sense? Here's hoping other people against LGBT rights look at them and go "Wait. We're on the same side? I may need to rethink my stance."

No, I'm pointing out that to draw that sort of conclusion from the article, or to imply that the arts are the domain of left-thinking people is ridiculous and self serving. The definition of circle jerking. Adding that I'm a lefty myself was to add to the legitimacy to my objectivity.

Pretty much all of New England is sitting pretty on this chart.
I was fat for the first 20 years of my life.  That caused a lot of teasing, etc.  But I know even morbidly obese people still manage to have friends, so other than that I don't know.  Maybe I just come off as an asshole.    There's always this cliche of "just go out and meet people lol!"  I can go out and interact with society for basic needs or even make inane elevator chat.  The thing is, though, is that I get out of the elevator or go home without any new friends.  I can tell that people really aren't interested in me, they're just being polite most of the time.

The first that I heard about this problem was from [this NPR report](http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=123042223).  This phrase really jumped out at me:  &gt;A key problem appears to be the absence of a mechanism that overrides the accelerator if the gas and brake pedals are pressed at the same time, Kane said.  That seems to indicate a problem in their computerized logic (hardware and/or software logic), and not just a simple problem of one piece of metal (the pedal) getting physically obstructed by another (the floor).

Wow, ok this one gets a story too.  It was a holiday weekend and there were a ton of people around.  We had 4 cocktail waitresses poolside which was a lot and we all had to share one computer.  We were talking amongst ourselves after one rotation of collecting orders, and we all saw the same boner.  We were to busy to do anything about it, so we let it slide for a while and forgot about it.  Literally two hours later I walk by the same guy again, and I realize its not his boner, thats just how he is flaccid.  Then I realized that all the people around him were girls and there were like 10 of them.  It was insane.  I have never seen a bigger schlong.  It had to have been bigger than my wrist and at least 9/10 inches and this was flaccid.  He realized I was staring in disbelief and gave me a big smile.  
If you ate 42 cupcakes a week, people would call you a fattie. Yet 42 beers a week is fine? Its not 6 beers in one sitting that is the problem, is 6 beers a night, EVERY NIGHT.  And it is probably stank-ass beer too.  My uncle did this for 30 years, he had a pre cancerous colon removed a few years ago, had to poop through a ostomy bag on 2 seperate occassions ( they messed up the surgery to reconnect his gut to his anus ) before they put him back together.  Now he has to eat a special diet because most of his colon is gone. My uncle was skinny as a pole, never got beer belly, but the drinking caught up with him.

This doesn't make sense to me at all... (1) this doesn't match my experience, as holding shopping bag handles at say a 80¬∞ angle to vertical does not make them seem 5 times heavier (2) the horizontal force components in the ropes cancel out at the point at which they are tied together and (3) conservation of energy demands that the work done by your hands as you are raising the shopping bags from the ground equals the potential energy gained by the bags, which, since your hands and the bags are moving the same distance, requires that the forces be equal also.  Your argument and equation illustrates the case where there are pulleys directly in front of (but not attached to or touching) each bag / sled, keeping the ropes parallel to the direction of motion on the bag-side, and transferring the force at an angle to your hands.  In this case, the distance (and therefore force) traveled by your hands vs. the bags is indeed different.
What year and model?  The Trance X and now discontinued Trance family of bikes are usually really good bets for a really good all purpose mountain bike. Most notable is pedaling efficiency.  I've ridden multiple Trances and thought at times that the pedaling efficiency was so good that I had the lockout/pro-pedal/floodgate active on the shock only to find out that the shock was fully open the whole time.  I have a Santa Cruz Blur LT Carbon and I would give the nod to the Trances I've ridden in terms of pedaling efficiency.

First, one must distinguish  between consciousness and perception. The latter is more cognitively primordial. Then, one must define consciousness in contrast to perception. I hold to Julian Jaynes' definition, which sees consciousness as an on-going process of narratizing reality within a functional "analog" workspace generated by lexical metaphors and figurative thought. Consciousness is literally "built on top of" unconscious perceptual processes through a linguistic scaffold learnt in childhood. Without language learning, a child will not develop consciousness.

How does the bail bond thing work?  Everything I know about Bail Bonds, I learned from watching a few episodes of "Dog the Bounty Hunter". :)  Sooo...  you needed $100k to get out of jail.  You pay the bail bond place $15k and they put up $100k to the jail? So the bail bond place gets $15k, then if you show up to the court date, they get their $100k back.  Is that correct?  Since you didn't show up, the bail bond place is out $85k.  Several people in this thread were saying "oh, don't worry.. the bail bond place doesn't have to pay out $100k" -- but they DID have to pay that for you to get out, yes?  So.. back to Dog the Bounty Hunter...  this bail bond place has their own guys, or hires out somebody like Dog, to look for you???  And then if Dog finds you and brings you in, the jail municipality gives the $100k back to the bail bond place... and the bail bond place gives a portion of this $100k to Dog.    Is that how it works??

It's hard to have a secret room of any size in a normal house though. I think most people would wonder why a part of house is accessible. We're accustomed to having spaces "taken up" by stairs and chimneys, but other than that, if there's a wall in a house you assume something else is right on the other side of it. You'd need a mansion just to disguise and distract from it.  Probably the easiest way would be a disguised sub-basement, and as long as you're going that route you might as well make it a reinforced bomb/zombie apocalypse/etc. shelter. That would be cool.

Why is alright when China preemptively invades a country out of fear that those in it might do something bad to them but not when the US does it?   &gt; Kinda makes sense that China got involved.  So does the US going into Iraq make sense as well because proximity really doesn't mean much in to days world...the US claimed it believed those in Iraq would do harm to them if they didn't strike first.

No, I had the car for 3-1/2 years at the time, paid $17,500 for it. At the time of the accident, the car booked for $9,800, but I only owed $3,000 on it. Since the insurance company totalled the car, they cut me a check for fair market value for a comparable replacement ($9,800), so after paying off what I still owed on the car loan ($3,000), I pocketed $6,800.  Edit: I know, I know, I didn't exactly get a good deal on a specific item I was buying, but hey, $6800 in my pocket is one hell of a bargain to me, especially after I figured the car was only worth about $5,000 and I would have made out $2,000 on the whole thing. The extra $4,800 that I wasn't planning on was a nice surprise. :)

There's an stigma in nudism in USA against the single male, as those are usually the ones who're supposed to go with strictly pervy purposes.  If you're acouple, you're a-ok. If you're a single woman, you're a-ok. But if you're a single male you're suspected right away. That's one problem i have against organized nudism in the USA.

This is all true.  The Church has historically made a distinction between internal government actions and wars.  The "just war" theory doesn't apply to supporting a government (or not supporting it) -- which is MUCH more open to interpretation, by them.  When there's an overt war then the church generally makes a statement.  When people are being "disappeared" and tortured by a government that may (or may not) be in power legitimately, but that supports the church, then there may be a gross amount of selective belief going on within the church politically.  It's impossible to ignore the fact that the US invades Iraq; it is, on the other hand, quite possible to *pretend* that people are not becoming the "disappeared" in a country that is not at war, especially in the days before the Internet and cable news.

That's the thing, it wasn't very far into it.  I felt a tinge of itch and thought I'd try the garlic thing since I'd heard about that...and after the garlic, wow, it got out of control.  I'm not blaming the garlic, necessarily, but it doesn't instill much confidence and given the pain that followed its use, I'm not eager to try it again!
Because of the way our society handles the elderly, basically shipping them off and away from the site of younger people, most don't really get to see what alzheimers does to a person. We get happy little sitcoms where it seems like it's just a fun party where you're a little goofy and confused but otherwise it's great! The reality is that it's closer to a living hell. 
That brings up another point.  If you did the KKK thing with "God hates niggers" would you get arrested/sued?  Surely fag is equivalent to nigger in harmfulness?  If they ever stop by my town, I'll call around to see what I can do.  Seeing a hood really wouldn't be too surprising where I live.

What you mean is that the CPU core of the A4 was licensed from ARM, as well as the GPU, but the A4 hybrid chip is completely redesigned by Apple/PA as besides a CPU and GPU, it also incorporates such things as a memory controller amongst other things.  If you read the Update #1 at the bottom of your submitted link, you'll see that while the "engine" is a ARM, the chassis is Apple.

Firefly, although it no longer runs and only has one season of episodes to watch. Well, then there's the movie, Serenity, but if you want a show that's still running, I suggest The Big Bang Theory or How I Met Your Mother. Both are hilarious, and TBBT has the whole geeky thing going for it; lots of scifi references that make the show way funnier for geeks than non-geeks.

I was swimming on a beach in Italy (far from home in Canada) with a friend.   We went out a bit far into the water, and I wasn't paying attention, so I got smacked in the face with a wave, which knocked my glasses off my face and into the deep water.    We searched around in the water for a few minutes, but eventually my buddy admitted, "man, they are gone. forget about em."  Easier said than done, as I'm pretty blind without em, and I didn't have any contacts with me.  I was pretty sure my vacation was ruined.     About an hour later, we're walking along a different part beach, knee deep in the water and he's giving me a hard time, describing all the pretty girls that I can't see.   Then he steps on something.."what the hell?"..reaches down into the water at his feet, and comes up with my glasses, completely intact.  Sweet.

I can't believe Obama still pushes that "clean coal" bullshit.  The US is [already importing](http://import-export.suite101.com/article.cfm/us_nuclear_fuel_imports_and_exports_in_2007) most of it's nuclear fuel from Russia and the Netherlands.  How about an energy plan that doesn't kill people with air pollution or put them massively in debt?  Not to mention the decades of lawsuits filed against the DOE to clean up their nuclear waste sites.  The waste at Hanford should be hitting the Columbia river about now.

I moved away after college to place where I didn't know anyone, so I know full well that saying to just go out and meet people is easier said than done. At the same time, I hope you realize that making friends takes a lot more than just a casual conversation in the elevator. If you're just having small chit-chat then it's not surprising that people don't seem interested in you. It's not just you; that happens to everyone. Have you tried meeting people with similar interests? You mentioned that you got a pilot license in another response. I think that makes great material for a conversation. I bet if you find someone who's currently in the process of getting his own license or would like to get one, he would enjoy talking with you.

I always thought Obama was putting up a facade of looking religious to appease the fundies. He doesn't strike me as a religious person at all, he only seems to speak of god as a silly American formality. This quote is especially applicable to the corrupt popes of the middle ages, they really messed things up in a tyrannical way.

I agree, that people who talk but don't add to the conversation can be boring or frustrating. I suspect the threshold and criteria for this is subjective. How do you quantify someone who is talking but not adding to a conversation?

Match the lube to the environment. There really isn't such thing as one lube to rule them all. If it's gonna be a wet ride, then use a wet lube. If it's gonna be a dry ride, then use a dry lube. I don't mean to say clean your chain and relube with the appropriate lube for every single ride, simply match the lube to what environmental conditions you will typically encounter.  For normal/wet conditions I like [Tri-Flow](http://www.triflowlubricants.com/Tri-Flow_Superior_Drip_Lubricant.html) or [Finish Line Ceramic Wet Lube](http://www.finishlineusa.com/products/ceramic_wet_lube.htm). For dry conditions I like [Finish Line Dry Teflon Lube](http://www.finishlineusa.com/products/teflon-plus-lube.htm). FWIW, I loathe wax lubes. They don't seem to hold up very well in my experience and over time they with build up and harden on your chain and end up being really difficult to clean when needed.

That's what I'm thinking, which was why I asked if subby was her husband's first. However, when I was too nervous to get it up for my first girlfriend, I found other ways to please her and kept trying. Maybe he's stressed out at work and thus too tired. Maybe he's realized that he's gay. Maybe she's gotten fat.

I understand that this is a gray area concerning ownership.  I don't consider it stealing because it's something they're happy to give away for free (they distribute them on sidewalks, in schools, to military members, etc.).  I'm not taking away from anyone's livelihood, although it could be argued that it costs them a nominal amount more because of increased demand beyond those who are seriously trying to read the bible.  It's like taking a free sample in the grocery store but throwing it in the trash instead of eating it.  Except the grocery store isn't spreading ridiculous statements and stifling progress by encouraging individuals to trade reason for faith.  Edit:  Changed "trying to stifle" to "stifling".  I doubt the Gideons are actively trying to stifle progress, but they are doing so regardless of whether they're aware of it or not.

Whales are highly intelligent, and appear to be sentient based on observations and studies so far. We don't tolerate humans killing humans, particularly for cannibalism, so why should we tolerate the killing of other intelligent and sentient species such as Whales, Dolphins, Great Apes, etc?   Is everything less intelligent and less sentient than us free game? I don't think people will like that position if a more advanced and more intelligent extraterrestrial species came here and decided to eat us.   I think we should endeavour to avoid killing other intelligent species unless we absolutely have to (e.g. starvation).

What do you like doing with your other friends?  Remember the "friend" part of "girlfriend".  For me, I've always enjoyed going record shopping and going to the thrift stores and taking road trips.  That's what I like doing anyway, and those are things I would do on a date.  And they let you talk to your date.  I'll echo that movies aren't much for a date, if you're interested in talking.  If you want to just make out in the back row, I guess there's value in that, but then there are better places for making out.

Anything you've been using for years is going to be "easier to use" than anything you switch to.  It's exactly why windows users think that mac is harder to use, and why mac users thing windows is harder to use.  There's an actual term for this, but I can't remember it.
AMP suits utilize human-like hands, so they can manipulate a wide variety of weapons.  If your mech suit has a humanoid hand, for gripping a wide variety of weapons, what type of close quarter slashing weapon would you find believable?

The Never Ending Story when Atrayu loses Artex in the swamp and is begging him to move as he sinks. I have never felt such profound sadness in my entire life and I was only like 7. The horsey was SO sad that he just wanted to be LEFT there. Oh god so horrible.

I think you fail to understand the importance of the space programs on the international stage. It's the ultimate in (peaceful) dick swinging for a nation.  When these low quality subcontractor twits are in charge of management as well as production, you can expect to hear about a lot more disasters and cockups.

Yeah, but aren't there like 30 people in that band? That they change out every three months? Accusing someone of being Chumbawumba is akin to accusing them of living in Britain.

IIRC, you can actually drop the 2 files for rdp (mstsc, and mstscax.dll) into the system32 folder and it works fine.  I may be mistaken though and it could be only good for outbound RDP connections.  Worth a shot.
This could end badly.

Watchme-oh wait. Yeah. So we were wrong.
Have you asked them for an early out? They probably aren't doing that any more but in the 90s that was common. If you can come up with a reason, dream job only open *right now*, etc, then that might work. If it doesn't you can always write your congressman and ask them to contact the command on your behalf. Seen that work...   The other point to remember is that it's only a year and a half and will go by very quickly.
I think I'd be into it...I enjoy anal play, and provided everyone is  clean and you don't go from ass to a) vagina or b) mouth (because that is a little bit sketchy)  Go anilingus.  Now, how to go about getting my partner into it is going to be difficult.  Bum is scary for men, I've found.

God forbid you do any of your own research before continuing to debate the topic.  http://business.maktoob.com/20090000428270/Top_Hamas_official_poisoned_in_Dubai_reports/Article.htm  This is a criminal investigation. I wouldn't be surprised if they intentionally do not mention the poison to aid in the investigation.   If someone doesn't know the methods used to kill him exactly, they can't pose successfully as someone that has information.   The current theory is his room was stormed by a group of up to seven men, a rag held to his mouth that may have been the delivery mechanism of the poison, and possibly electrocuted as well.
The Neverending Story.  The scene where Atreyu confronts the [wolf](http://catfish.transworld.net/files/2008/08/wolf.jpg).  Looks kind of goofy now, but on that night many years ago I got no sleep.
Yeah, more than likely. In the south "army worm" ususally means 'tent caterpillar". Its confusing though, becasue there really IS an "army worm" species that occasionally crops up in the south, but originate from Africa.  Did you know some people make **WINE** from tent caterpillars/army worms? apparently the little dudes are so full of sweet leaf juice they ferment very well.
Good God.  I think I just threw up in my mouth a little...
ive never actually heard this idea before and i can say in stone cold sobriety that its the most intriguing explanation ive heard thus far
endurance running means you chase prey until it dies of exhaustion. I don't think a T-rex is the type of animal that would run away from humans. Plus if it did you would could probably make do with leisure walkers than endurance runners

Credit is bullshit. I posted elsewhere in the thread in detail.  I have been at the same company for 4 yrs now.  During the time period (actually of 6 months) I went from a 500ish fico to 780ish fico.  I didn't decide to work any harder when my credit score changed, though banks and anyone that saw it stopped treating me like dirt.  I still am the same person I was before I fixed up my credit.

So what is the proper method of ear wax removal?    I can't believe I'm in my 30's and just found out that q-tips are bad.  I mean, people always said not to stick them in your ears, but I thought that was because if you were clumsy you could puncture your eardrum.  So I was like, "I'm too awesome to do that, and I gotta get this wax out, so in goes the q-tip."."
that's more than "acceptable". Where I come from that is what's known as PROFITABLE.

If that is the metaphor, the real place (or state of existence, if you prefer) must be quite terrible.

Hmm...I'm not sure what you mean by the tracks being out of sync; the backing itself was just based on a crappy midi file, probably intended for use in ringtones, which seemed to have the timings right [hence why it was nearly identical to the original].  Do you think there could have been a delay inherent to the samples I used?  As for the voice timings, I was trying to copy Shatner's style, who generally doesn't seem to deviate very far from the backing "melody".

If someone successfully performed this operation, they could remotely force a shutdown or kill processes on a server, which would clearly introduce problems for everyone.

I went through 12 years of hardcore depression by growing up in Kansas as a gay kid. I contemplated suicide many times.  I was a stupid fuck to think it was the right way out.   If I had the choice to either die, or go through it again, I would gladly do it again.  Edit : Awaiting response of "ohhhh it wasn't bad enough"

We would tell a manager if it seemed to be a problem.  erections weren't allowed so most people would just cover them up if they got one on accident.  I would never report someone if I thought it was an accident, but if they were being pervy we could get them kicked out.    This one time there was an old old man who came into our restaurant with a huge boner, he must have had 2 or 3 blue helpers, and it was probably the only one he was getting that year.  Well, it seemed he was just trying to get away from the crowds and calm down, so I left him alone, but one of my friends got pissy about it and called the manager over who told him he had to cover it up.  The old man got really defensive and he shouted "My arm's hard do I have to cover that up too?" Hysterical.

I wish there were a way you could prove any of this, because I don't believe it for a second.  Who paid the bail for you, since you were in jail?  You say you pawned your stuff, but  again you pay bail THEN get out of jail.  Not to mention you must have had a LOT of high dollar stuff to get even a minor percent of that money from a pawn shop.  Why the hell would you tell your attorney you planned to skip bail and leave the country?  You could atleast provide a name of one of your accomplices to prove this, right?
Really? Try pancreatic cancer. Also, go you Mr. tough-guy. You get to decide that you'll bear any pain just to exist. Let others make their own decisions. We all die, no matter how hard we cling to life. Some of us don't want our final years to be horrible pain mixed with losing our own identifies. Existing is dependent on identify, not just heart beat.  Edit: Somehow I missed this: "Everyone has a right to live their life if they please, even if that involves ending it." I still think you sound pretty judgmental about others choices, but I'm more supportive of what you said.
Actually it was 1987.  Bad Taste was filmed, written, directed, produced and edited by Peter Jackson (and friends). It was done on the cheap, filmed on weekends across 4 years for about $25k NZD. All the special effects were homemade, in particular the masks were baked in Peter Jackson's Mum's oven.    It's a particular testament to the film-making vision of Jackson himself. Also the filming process is a great example of the "No.8 wire" culture of New Zealanders innovating and coming up with inventive solutions from unlikely sources.   Peter Jackson also played a starring role as Derek in which he got to utter two of the best lines in movie history:   "Dereks don't die" and   "I'm born again"
We definitely need more Jurassic Park material. Doesn't matter if it's a book, a movie, or a game, we just need more of it. There are so many possibilities for that literary world.  But anyway, I think a big problem with the premise here is that the dinosaurs aren't necessarily pursuing you, certainly not in the same way that zombies do. Sure, there are the carnivores, but even they won't hunt if they're not hungry. You've gotta have a reason for them to be after you.  I also think hiding would be a very important game mechanic, as well as door functionality.  I can think of a lot of cool scenes from the books and movies that would work great. I'd love to play the scene where they're riding on the motorcycle, being chased by raptors, ducking between the feet and tails of a herd of apatosaurs trying to defend themselves.

No, some very literally got addicted to Heroin, gradually spent their life's savings on it, alienated nearly all their friends because of it, and one eventually overdosed.  You tell me why a substance that can compel somebody to do that should be legal.  The right to ingest anything you desire does not include something that no man in their right mind would participate in if they were fully aware of what was in store for them. Most got into it because they were naive, and, like everyone else, thought they were perfectly in control and that they would never become a slave to drugs. How wrong they were.

I've come to think that given the popularity of Arian Christianity in North Africa and the far eastern Roman Empire, that the Arians converted to Islam, as it's actually not that far removed from what the Arians seemed to believe about Christ--that He was the Messiah but was not God.  Yes, the form of worship was different, but Islam's teachings about Christianity seem to be of the kind that would cause an Arian that heard what Islam preached to be acceptable.  Of course, it may just be me assuming that the decline in Arian Christianity and the rise of Islam at about the same time (in the places where Arians came into contact with Muslims) are related events.

I was biking along in Brooklyn, and saw some guilty-looking guy on a bike being chased by some other dudes. I asked them if the guy just stole their bike, they yelled "yes", so I biked after the thief, and was soon joined in the pursuit by a fellow cyclist. After some swerving around cars, running red lights, and bunny-hopping a couple curbs (mostly unnecessary, but it added to the cool factor), we caught up with the guy, who took off and ditched the bike, which we returned to the owners. 
Makes for a moving target if people arrive at multiple times.  Then again, cell phones.

New York. I found a method which looks good using a pin, bottle cap, and a cup. Light, blow out, let smoke fill cup, suck out with a bendy-straw. How big of a pinch should I use at first, like a half a pinkie nail?  I had to laugh when I found this, because it is so many years later...my friend used to find random shit like this in his pockets all the *time*. Even after coming home from the airport. Which was scary, but funny. We had a bit of a falling out, which I'm bummed about, otherwise I'd call him about this. He's still in Germany, I think.
so that is why they call it the sticky.

It is irrelevant though.  I seriously doubt any of the people still playing 1.6 will embrace this mod more than they did CSS.   It's essentially got the same challenges that Valve had, trying to mimic an old engine with a new one.  And Valve had the benefit of original source code an genius developers.
Some of the signs in City 17 were in russian, which I always thought was odd.  Somehow I thought City 17 was supposed to be in the US, probably because everyone spoke English (with an American accent no less).  Whether it's in Russia or not, they definitely drew heavily some photos like this for inspiration.

It is difficult from your description to know whether to be happy for you or not. I know the US has some ridiculously harsh anti drug laws and some horrendous sentencing, but from your description you where not a simple mule/user/stooge. It sounds like it was not just a "Stupid mistake" it sounds like you where maliciously involved in with "Bad people doing bad things" with no guilt an no remorse. If you are now a positive contributor to legal society not harming anyone it is probably better that you are contributing than sucking US taxpayers dry. But if you did not take the opportunity to change then you are just a smug ass hole who learned nothing and I hope you get what's coming.
my neighbor when i was growing up was a drunk who beat his wife whilst drunk. she left him, and now he's dying of liver failure. i also just bought a six-pack from the corner.  
For me it was DDR/Bemani series.  There is an arcade around here called Playdium that you buy a card at and the machines use cards.  We'd go every weekend and get unlimited play cards that lasted 12 hours. 12 straight hours of DDR and Bemani games every week as well as unlimited nights at another arcade in the area. There would be days we'd play 6-7 hours and then wake up and go right back for another 6-7. Then the home version on top of that. Beatmania IIDX, PnM, DDR, guitar freaks and drum mania all at home and arcade.  Over 6 or 7 years I must have played at least 10000 hours.
I was more of an asshole in my first comment than I should have been, so I edited it to just be the correction. 
And where would they keep their card?
I suppose I should clarify.  Burden of proof is on the one making the *absurd* claim. If I claim there is a sky, I don't need to prove it to anyone other than the most hardcore devil's advocates- I can just kind of wave my hands in an upward direction and say, there it is. If I claim there isn't one, well, then people ought to be asking me some serious questions.

Hey, that's cool!  Just a thought, if you are still in the design stage, the underlying sketchup linework could be rendered as a "pencil sketch" linetype to convey to the client that the design isn't permanent yet.  Or there is a feature to extend the lines at intersections, if you know the rendering style I mean.

the laundromat i use has plastic bags stocked for just this purpose.  so if all the machines are full and somebody's load is finished it is acceptable to put their clothes in a plastic bag.  i think this is quite a neat solution as it ensures that nobody has to wait longer than necessary, and that when you remove someone's clothes they wont have to sit on a dirty drier or the floor, etc.  
of the multi-million person audience, how many people would have deigned to go to Target to get these?

No, I've never worried about getting pushed overboard - I'm a single-hander.   You may know exactly what you're talking about, but what you do isn't going to be right for everyone, whether on a body-goal or mental/spiritual level.

Unless you're trying to perpetuate the dim muscle-head stereotype, in which case you're doing a fantastic job.

**Do not underestimate Microsoft where they see a market opening up.**  This is the folly of many, many companies. They see a broad, valuable market in web applications and too many people look at their past failures and ignore the comebacks and surprise successes. Now that the web is more than just a toy, they'll put their best people (like the people who wrote the .NET JIT, and such) behind it. Do not underestimate that.  Google's people, Mozilla's people cannot sit down and say "We have done good enough. Microsoft will not beat us." If they are going to keep the web open, they need to keep pushing for open standards and competition. Microsoft can deal with both, but once there's no incentive to keep it open, they will not hesitate to introduce proprietary extensions. That's, well, that's just business. For better and worse.
Irrelevant. You still embrace the whole idea of someone becoming a soldier to be some epitome for selflessness for the greater good of everyone else. It's this kind of mindset that causes good, albeit ignorant, people to leave their homes and accidentally shoot an unarmed civilian in a "suspicious looking house". We too (a nameless European state) have a military presence in Afghanistan, yet I don't see anyone around me cheerfully screaming in glee for the morons that chose to transfer there (AFAIK, you can't be forced to leave the country unless it is in a full-scale war). Matter of the fact is, those people are quite frowned upon and rightly so. If your government chooses to jump the bandwagon and run rampaging into a foreign country, the last thing a well-intentioned citizen should do is join the very armed forces that are carrying out these fanciful tasks.

I'm glad you guys had a sense of humor about it (although, I suppose you'd have to have one to work there). The one time I witnessed other people having sex, I was not a happy camper. It was in my college dorm, and I had what felt like a furious case of the shits, and I ran into the 3rd floor bathroom seeking salvation.   The two twits going at it by the sinks (what was wrong with the showers?) stopped in mid-pump, completely surprised that someone had walked in. They then informed me (not politely, I must say) that I could be next in line to experience the dude's dong if I didn't vacate the bathroom.  I almost didn't make it to the 2nd floor bathrooms.

The pulling force is along the direction of the rope. Therefore the projection onto the direction of motion will be T/cos(theta), which is more than the tension in the perfectly straight case.  You can't think of them as one big sled, what matters is the *angle* of the rope, which results in a higher force being exerted to overcome friction.
I'm very different in that I don't think much of death.  People seem to freak out whenever someone dies, and I can't figure out why.  I'm not religious, but I've accepted that everyone is going to die, including me.  It's just a fact.  My wife, son, parents, brothers, sister, friends, loved ones, neighbors, etc are all going to die.  What really boggles me is when a person who truly believes in a god breaks down over a loved one's death.  If I believed that my loved one is now in a better place with our savior, I'd rejoice.  Everyone I know gets very depressed, sometimes for a very long time.

No, some very literally got addicted to Heroin, gradually spent their life's savings on it, alienated nearly all their friends because of it, and one eventually overdosed.  You tell me why a substance that can compel somebody to do that should be legal.  The right to ingest anything you desire does not include something that no man in their right mind would participate in if they were fully aware of what was in store for them. Most got into it because they were naive, and, like everyone else, thought they were perfectly in control and that they would never become a slave to drugs. How wrong they were.

Yeah, I meant George Mason. They have a lot of specialists in Austrian Econ, I have no idea if their program is less mathematical.  Also, you seem to be implying that you're in an Econ MA program. May I ask where? I had always heard that they're only useful for people who didn't major in Econ in college, that you should really either be content with a BA or go for the PhD... what's your view on this? Not trying to be a dick, but I had to ask...
This is what UAV combat will look like in ten years. A micro-aerial vehicle with guns and live video, capable of stealthy kills in urban terrain.  And here's the scary part: in no more than twenty years, any insurgent or Joe Q. Postalworker will be able to build one in his garage.
Hey, so your title would imply you're a shooter, so I'm assuming you edit on the side?  Personally I'm in the same boat, and moving to NYC soon so I'm trying to get a feel for the professional climate. Do you work for a company or freelance? Did you go to grad school?  (sorry to bombard you with questions!)
I like to plant it in bunkers on Afghan.  Plant your c4, move to the other bunker, and detonate when someone else is in there.  I plant it on the ceilings.  You can also plant it at the top of the cliff, in between the paint can and rock.

I was walking on a bridge over a highway one day where I found a cd on the ground. I'm really good at flicking cards so I flicked it off the bridge. It flew for a good 20ft when it just shattered into tens of pieces for no reason at all. I thought it was cool.

My brothers are spectacular at catching grapes with their mouth. On several occasions I've personally watched one of them toss a grape over our two story house and have the other catch it.

i have no problem understanding. you seem to be incapable of realising that your opinion of how search should work is not somehow more correct than anyone else's.   if you want to find links relevant to some topic then you need to start using google without a "site:reddit.com" specifier. it's quite good at finding relevant things - and much better than the old-web search engines that use the tagging/categories/keywords strategy you seem to think is fantastic. stop bitching at reddit for not being yahoo categories from the mid-90s.

What if what you were doing was having an affair with the other person's spouse?  It becomes a lie of omission.  So, where do you draw the line about when withholding information is acceptable and when it's not?  For people who are unable to lie, withholding information could be equally difficult, and norms would develop differently.

I like to appreciate the things people will do in total sincerity, like going to foreign countries with no amenities and trying to help people that don't want them there.  There have been things they've helped with, things they've fucked up and I think that's its own discussion.  I appreciate their sincerity and their will-power.  I disagree with saving nations when our own needs a lot of work.  I also agree with the idea that soldiers are trained to kill, they are not trained to save lives, that may be a side effect of the killing.  Killing is, however, their job.  That may be really simple minded, but that's what a military does.

He also, location permitting, would take a nap on their naked corpse after the kill.

Finding someone that meets these criteria has been an amazing bit of luck. 
You're assuming that there is a surplus of labor. The opposite can also occur, where there is a shortage of labor, as often occurs in booming economies. When there is a shortage of labor, employers are forced to bid higher wages for the workers they need.  The 'bargaining power' evens out in the long run between the employer and the consumer. 
So is having exactly the kind of sex you want to have.
Whales are highly intelligent, and appear to be sentient based on observations and studies so far. We don't tolerate humans killing humans, particularly for cannibalism, so why should we tolerate the killing of other intelligent and sentient species such as Whales, Dolphins, Great Apes, etc?   Is everything less intelligent and less sentient than us free game? I don't think people will like that position if a more advanced and more intelligent extraterrestrial species came here and decided to eat us.   I think we should endeavour to avoid killing other intelligent species unless we absolutely have to (e.g. starvation). 
I reckon you should cross the road to avoid white folks for lols

Just a thought....I wonder what they would do if you walked over in a realistic KKK outfit with a sign that read "God hates niggers" and stand next to them....would they care?   My thinking is maybe out do their extremism, and make them uncomfortable with outlandish over the top extreme stuff that even they shake their heads at. 
yes, but it's exactly that type of thinking that will hinder change.   Be the change you want to see in the world. According to your logic, if everybody took that advice and paid with cash, then the situation would fix itself.

Short answer, yes. But it wasn't a weather weapon - just ordinary explosives that brough down a few hundred government buildings. Not HAARP or even a nuke - just regular bombs. Not one big one, but several (maybe 200 or so) small ones. Oh and the USGS lied about it being a 7.0 quake.

The Shining - agreed.  I remember seeing a *preview* for the Shining a few months before its release.  The preview, as I recall, was silent and set in the hotel lobby framed on the elevator doors.  The doors open slowly and a torrent of blood comes pouring out in slow-mo and eventually fills the room so that all the viewer sees is a screen of red.  That fucked with my little mind for many nights.

I find sometime's even when your hurt it's best to tell other how you feel. Sometimes an emotional outburst can be the mirror that show's someone how cruel they are being. I don't suggest making it petty, keep insults to a minimal but be passionate.

If the company wants the workers to have more skills, it should train them and pay for that training instead of expecting those workers to randomly walk off and learn the stuff on their own.

The end of story is this, if you give anyone the opportunity to do a brute hack, then you are doomed.

But...but...market theory says there are never arbitrages....  I feel the entire point of this is to some extent stop arbitrage attempts. The vast, vast majority of arbitrages are not accessible to the average person (or to the mutual funds/large investment funds they have their money in) due to the fact that they exist for fractions of a second and have profits of fractions of a cent per transaction, thus you have to flood the market to get some real profit out of it (which large firms have the ability to do). Some people defend this behavior as making sure the market works properly....and to some extent they're right. But basically it means that large firms no longer have to be good at analyzing stocks, they just need fast computers and quick trades. It'd be nice to see firms actually have to know what they're doing when it comes to stock picking/portfolio building to earn profits again.

Israel and the U.S. certainly have some bad policies and stupid ideas about how to protect their national security, but I don't see much of what they do as terrorism. Even during the Bush administration--which I utterly despised--I don't recall ever thinking that the Bushies were "terrorists."  I'm not claiming to be unbiased here. The U.S. is my country, so that's inevitably going to affect my perception of its actions. I'm also a Jew who loves Israel and has family there, so I'm going to be biased in that case as well.

&gt;Arsenal were absolutely terrible at the back today.  Agreed. Gallas kept getting (inexcusably) caught in the counter, and Clichy was absolutely worthless. Vermaelen's not bad, but he seems to press too far forward, which catches him out of position too frequently. With the fact that he was the only one who could put the ball on target today, maybe he should just be put at forward, and Wenger should buy a whole new back line.

I don't either. Although I can see why some people would.  Depending on how much you earn, you can qualify for matching contributions from the federal government, and there are lower taxes on super earnings (although I'm far from an expert on this!).

I know plenty of smart, liberal, perfectly sane Christians whom I have deep respect for as people, even if I think they are fundamentally wrong in their metaphysical and moral beliefs.

Certainly he did.

ok, here's the deal:   If someone reposts, and it gets upvoted, it mean that people either haven't seen it or still enjoy it.  Reddit is a wonderfully democratic system, and as such it has this thing called the "downvote" which allows you to express your disapproval for items you have already seen.  If enough people are upset that the same item has been reposted, the item will get downvoted and will not show up.  My point is, commenting "repost" will not magically make this post go away or dissuade people who haven't seen it from posting it in the future, so I see no point to it other than to whore karma from people who are just as obsessive about reposts as you.

I hope they do a tribute to mili vanili.  they were called criminals 20 years ago after they won a grammy even though they weren't really singing.  now with lady gaga and nearly every other popular artist using auto-tune, it turns out mili vanili weren't criminals, they were innovators.  way ahead of their time.
Yes, however a deflection does not suffice in quelling my curiosity....    Why is the other variant more surprising?

I tried to get my mom to use gmail. I even set it up so all her hotmail emails would be forwarded to her gmail. Caught her a week later signing into hotmail. oh well.
The 360 doesn't claim to be a computer. It's a toy and it has no pretensions of being anything else. There's no reasonable expectation that it should be able to run bittorrent or do your taxes. It has little to no potential to mislead consumers (like myself, thanks very much) into believing Xbox Live's lack of Firefox and porno games is the source of the system's usability and security.  I have rejected and continue to reject the appeal to the market. No shit Apple's going to sell a million of these - it's shiny and new and the artificial restrictions aren't going to affect 90% of users. If it had this damning flaw and was also a terrible product for other reasons, I wouldn't have given it more than a moment's notice.   MIDs, by the by, tend to be x86 UMPCs or run a real OS like Maemo. They are rarely more restrictive than a slow computer.

If you don't give a shit, why are you so pissed off? If you really didn't give a shit, and only cared about blah, blah, blah, you'd repost it again and again without bitching and whining.  But you've missed the point completely. The point is, we KNOW, we've already seen what you're selling and we bought it from someone else who packaged it better.
Videos like this always make me feel bad about myself.  I have no real talent. :(

Except that the high levels of Omega 6 relative to Omega 3 in corn-fed beef and farmed salmon probably are bad for you, so stick with grass-fed beef and wild salmon, which have much better ratios.
Cue Christians chiming in, citing some passage from the Bible to be interpreted as best suits their existing argument.  *Edit*: As per nosurprisehere's comment.
What can I say? I got this computer a few years ago, and I'm too poor to afford a new one.  Also, it still works.
I'm always amazed at stuff like this. Did the artist have the outline of Conan's face drawn on the board? I can't imagine figuring out the shading when you're working with such a big piece. I'd probably waste hours just stepping back make sure I was getting it right. Then again, I don't have much artist/drawing talent, so maybe that's why.
You can usually find them if they've been on Guitar Hero/Rock Band. Some Guitar Hero-clone forums usually have the isolated tracks along with the rythm game charts such as [Frets on Fire](http//www.fretsonfire.net) . Most torrent sites should also have them if you try searching for "Guitar Hero/Rock Band tracks". If you just want Metallica isolated tracks you can find them [here](http://mastertracks.webs.com/downloadlinks.htm).

&gt; The pulling force is along the direction of the rope.  THIS is the reason why, and you need to make it clearer in your drawing:  If the ropes are *tied together* at the handles (as they appear in your drawing), then there will be no apparent increase in force, as the pulling force is in the direction of motion.  If the ropes are *held separately* (as your calculations assume), then there *will* be an apparent increase in force, because the normal force exerted by each bag/sled on the other is transmitted through the ropes to your hands, which then must work *against* each other to keep the sleds in horizontal equilibrium.  Lesson 1: don't assume, lest you make an ass out of u and me.  Lesson 2: if you want to make your two kids in two sleds weigh less, tie the ropes together.

Anything by Smuttynose for sure. That brewery is fantastic. If you want to try something truly unique go for Dogfish Head.   What did you like about Arrogant Bastard?   Also, get your hands on Victory. Especially HopDevil, Prima Pils, and Storm King Stout.   If you see Sierra Nevada Bigfoot, definitely pick that up as an intro into extreme beers. I'm sure it'll be crazy your first few sips, but it's what got me into extreme beers. I've been into craft beer for 2 years and I get a new six pack every week. Check reviews at Beer Advocate, as well. Anything B or above is definitely worth checking out when you're getting into beer. 
Well as far as I understand it, string theory as it exists today makes no testable predictions whatsoever.  If it has no testable predictions, then its existence or nonexistence are, to us, indistinguishable.  Any technology dependent on string theory would BE a testable prediction OF string theory.  So none.
here's an idea; quit being a mooch and buy it.
I don't get it.

As shown here   http://www.cheesemaking.com/store/pg/124.html  You must use milk that isn't ultra-pasteurized.

If it's really bothering you (and it sounds like it is, as it would me), I would seek couples counseling. The adjustment to married life can take a toll and maybe this is expressing itself in his libido? It could be other things, stress from his job, or some other area; there's no way a redditor would be able to identify the cause. Whatever it is it's obviously deeply affecting him, or maybe, just maybe, he has a low libido. some men do.   I understand your need to feel sexy and wanted in a marriage, every female needs it to some extent. I hope you find a solution :( update us if you do?
These sites didn't have what I was looking for.
I was in a bar, throwing pencils at the ceiling with my friends. Suddenly, one of them fell, bounced (the eraser part hit) off the table, and went up my friend's nose. We were laughing, all he could do was say "Am I dead? Am I dead?"

&gt;violate the sovereignty of Switzerland  And Switzerland/UBS broke no laws in regards to US tax evasion? The US is basically playing hardball. I have no problem with that. At least we didn't invade them like the multiple countries we have already. Any country we have a military base on is a violation of that country's sovereignty.  &gt;only to gain a few short-term political points.  in your opinion. I believe it will be positive in the long term. If a country knowingly breaks US laws or actively looks the other way, we will prosecute them to the fullest extent.

And bicycles are too cheap and fast.
&gt;The end of story is this, if you give anyone the opportunity to do a brute hack, then you are doomed. You must never reveal the hashed password, salts or allow someone to repetitively request wrong information without any kind of "increasing" span.  By this logic we may as well store passwords in plain text.  Clearly our protections will always be perfect, right?  The entire point of hashing passwords is that if shit hits the fan and someone *does* manage to read the password database, you're still not 100% fucked.
Won't you go blind doing this? (pun and serious)
Happythankyoumoreplease was a great film, especially for a first time writer/director.  I heard mixed things about Hesher.  I actually met the cinematographer while waiting in line for a movie.  He was an awesome guy.
&gt; How? Basically, it‚Äôs slow as hell. It uses a variant of the Blowfish encryption algorithm‚Äôs keying schedule, and introduces a work factor, which allows you to determine how expensive the hash function will be. Because of this, bcrypt can keep up with Moore‚Äôs law. As computers get faster you can increase the work factor and the hash will get slower.

I think you might mean $250,000 NZD (I thought it was around 300K, actually).  EDIT: My brain mashed up Braindead with Bad Taste (removed reference), but the other figures were relatively correct.

I finally decided to try out your recipe.  I wish I had a kitchen scale, but I had to convert to volume.  I like a little less chocolate in my cookies, so I used 24oz instead of 36.  I'm sorry, but I honestly couldn't believe you only used a pinch of baking soda; I used .75 tablespoons (or .3 oz).  Refrigerated the dough before spooning it out and my roomates and I all agree that the cookies are excellent!  The taste is dead on, the texture is... well, honestly a little less gooey than I'd like but that's probably my fault for not believing you on the baking soda.  Will make again, though I'll probably cut quantitiy down by half next time.
My F5 key can't take too much more suspense.
You will come harder then almost any other time in your life.   Think of the ass as the last great widely un-explored sexual region - it's a little scary, and people get the wrong idea of how to approach it thanks to porn. It requires gentle teasing and licking, not painful ramming.  If the whole dirtyness thing freaks you out, a good way to start experimenting is using cling wrap. No smell, no full contact, close to full sensation.

Haha @ "green city"!    We're good on that though.    In Chicago we just did a wide range of dining, and went out to bars with friends most of the time...  I guess that's not that exciting really.  I'm really going to miss the variety of restaurants we had in Chicago, but I guess a town this size can't compare!  Are you living in Chatt now?  We live in Hixson.
I get that same feeling but I get it before I even leave my house to go to the store to buy the game. So I usually stay home and torrent it.
As I've pointed out before.  What we're debating is the social contract. Implied consent is established once you become of age and partake of societies services and protections.  When you turn 18 you are free to jump into the ocean and leave. No aggressor will stand in your way.  You are born with absolutely no rights to property. You only have the right to your own body, and no aggressor is stopping you from removing yourself from the social contract.  
You understand it to a mild degree you say? You read a book once? Tell me: what do *you* think the technological implications of string theory are?
I'm going to share another awesome UAV tactic:  It's the perfect weapon to take down the apache and the black hawk. Just **ram** the enemy helicopter, fly under or above it and push it up/down (apparently the UAV weighs enough to push the big choppers around, who knew?) 99% of the time this will cause the enemy to crash into the ground, and it won't even damage the UAV.  Also it's fucking hilarious.
ROOOOOOOOOOOOGUE!   Get it all.

is there a list of what's been uploaded, sorted by genre? it would be interesting to see. also... and i understand why, but i can't help feel a little hurt that avant-garde is, essentially, relegated to a time with the least potential number of listeners (in the US anyway) - and even then it's still mixed with everything else. are there even that many songs tagged as A-G that aren't also, technically, electronic - and could, technically, be included in the 11pm-2am block?   *on a semi-related note:*  what about letting people - radio reddit members, anyway - create their own play lists from the list of uploaded tracks (which could then be shared and voted on)?

CSS has the same guns and maps but it plays a lot differently.  Some key differences off the top of my head:  * More random spread patterns when going full auto.  In 1.6, bullets go above the corsshair as you spray.  In CSS, they spread out more randomly.  * Larger hit boxes.  * Slower walking speed, doesn't allow you to move as quickly without making any noise.  Basically, CSS is more random and more friendly to novice players.  Valve has been continuing this trend for a long time.  1.6 had bigger hit boxes than 1.5 and added equipment like the tactical shield.  Then there was a patch for 1.6 released in late 2003 or early 2004 that made the recoil for M4 and AK more random and added AWP scope delay.  You used to be able to quick switch with the AWP and bring up the scope immediately.  Those were the days...
You're assuming that there is a surplus of labor. The opposite can also occur, where there is a shortage of labor, as often occurs in booming economies. When there is a shortage of labor, employers are forced to bid higher wages for the workers they need.  The 'bargaining power' evens out in the long run between the employer and the consumer.

That looks like a series of cheap shots to me... if this weapon has any basis in physical reality, all of those maneuvers should have destroyed it. You can't plow a little helicopter into a person / wall / telephone pole and still have it in working condition. Is it also silent?   I would try it myself, but my beta key was already in use.

I've never actually seen that before, but it doesn't come as a surprise if someone else has suggested the integral thing. It's the mathematically sane choice.  &gt; Regardless, the only point that I would advocate my own death, is if I am brain-dead and can no longer experience anything anyway.  Honestly, I have a hard time believing that, but if it's true, then either a) you're irrational, or b) you value even negative experience more than you fear pain/death.  &gt; I'm not afraid of death. Just like I'm not afraid of the time before I was born.  Agreed. I do, however, fear pain, and since I don't fear death, it would be a convenient way to get out of pain if I thought a lot was headed my way.
How did you emotionally deal with losing all your earthly possessions? How would you deal with the situation if it happened again to you?  I guess what I am driving at is: Did losing everything in the fire make you the sort of person who is not very attached to material objects/things?

I do that with every game I play.  It's more fun for me if I can somehow get inside the mind of the character.

He also, location permitting, would take a nap on their naked corpse after the kill.
Do you have any evidence to that effect? 
Thanks OP for taking time to post and answer questions.    My apologies for trolling earlier.    I salute you for escaping the American gulag.  Sorry about our sick desire to lock everyone up for life.  I really don't know what the hell got into us, but I can only hope that as our empire decays, we will find more important things to do with our dwindling resources.    Here's a question... Does the EU or your home country care about your US conviction [arrest? conviction?]?  Are there extradition treaties in force, or does the EU not send it's citizens off to our hellish penal colonies?    Do you think you enjoy your life more, knowing you could have been locked up?    Good luck, stay free!

The pulling force is along the direction of the rope. Therefore the projection onto the direction of motion will be T/cos(theta), which is more than the tension in the perfectly straight case.  You can't think of them as one big sled, what matters is the *angle* of the rope, which results in a higher force being exerted to overcome friction.
OP must be great at parties. 
It's clear to me now just what kind of nerd you are.
keep in mind the Canadian retailers are paying much larger taxes to the Canadian govt to support things like healthcare and are forced to pay their employees higher wages (assuming the warehouse staff make minimum wage).  While I agree that double seems like a lot there is a price to be paid for our higher standard of living in Canada

I would say there was, but there were never any fights over it or anything.  I think they pretty much just left the issues alone, or addressed them at board meetings.  I think they had a little respect for each other because of their common beliefs even if they didn't agree with some aspects of their lifestyles.   I think that most people that were there were at least bi sexual because so many of them were swingers.  The only people they didn't really accept were Trans-genders.  A few Trans-gender men came to the resort once, and they were not well received.  On the other hand there was a cross dressing guy that was there all the time, and everyone loved him.
Can you give us an idea of your usual style and body shape?

Or, go as catwoman--black leggings, black boots (preferably knee high and stuff) and then go over to a party supply store and get a whip and some glasses or somesuch. Whether you're good or evil depends on you :)  What about [Harley Quinn](http://blogs.sundaymercury.net/anorak-city/Batman%20Harlequin.jpg)? Difficult costume, but so great.

My parents are members there! Luckily this is something they only do there on the weekends! They kept it a secret from my brother and I for quite some time. But the little investigators we were, we found out before they had the guts to tell us. Since then, my brother has even gone with them a few times.
First thing that pops into mind:  I had a bottle of deerpark water in my High School's cafeteria 7 (or so) years ago.  It was about 2/3 full.  Some conversation (don't remember it) led to be joking about my god-like dexterity, and how I'm so good I could throw this water bottle in the air, flip it, and have it land on its cap (this was all a lie; I mean I'm fairly dexterous, but nothing to write legends about).  I was joking the whole time, but I finally threw it in the air.  To their, and my, surprise, it actually landed on its lid, and the whole table was amazed.  I refused to do it again, and most of them never knew if I was just blowing smoke the whole time and got lucky, or actually was that talented.
I don't get it...
I think so.  The first one with the discussion about deleting emails and discussion about the guy who kept trying to get the raw data having died.
mainly to show that people are going to fuck themselves up no matter the legality of something. as for heroin, making it illegal just forced the users into unregulated underworld black-market hell.

No.  When we all go out someone inevitably gets motorboated.
Most 7.62x54r ammo is corrosive and requires that you clean your rifle after firing. My understanding is that a dark barrel means the gun was not taken care of/cleaned correctly. Just a sign of the gun not being in good shape.

I saw Fire in the Sky when I was 3 or 4. For those of you who havent seen that movie it has one of the scarriest alein abduction sequences ever in it. I was scarred of Aliens for at least 10 years after that. Countless nights spent on my parents floor. A couple of years ago I decided to rent it and see if it was as scary as I remembered, well it was. Freakin terrifying. Thanks for that mom and dad. No way Im going to let my kids see it. I'm 22 now.
Those are fantastic, dude.  You should start propositioning musicians/bands, because you would make a great album cover.

How does the bail bond thing work?  Everything I know about Bail Bonds, I learned from watching a few episodes of "Dog the Bounty Hunter". :)  Sooo...  you needed $100k to get out of jail.  You pay the bail bond place $15k and they put up $100k to the jail? So the bail bond place gets $15k, then if you show up to the court date, they get their $100k back.  Is that correct?  Since you didn't show up, the bail bond place is out $85k.  Several people in this thread were saying "oh, don't worry.. the bail bond place doesn't have to pay out $100k" -- but they DID have to pay that for you to get out, yes?  So.. back to Dog the Bounty Hunter...  this bail bond place has their own guys, or hires out somebody like Dog, to look for you???  And then if Dog finds you and brings you in, the jail municipality gives the $100k back to the bail bond place... and the bail bond place gives a portion of this $100k to Dog.    Is that how it works??

The US census lumps a lot of groups together when it is convenient.  Such as "African-Americans" include groups from all over (immigrants and slave decedents).  So that isn't a good standard.    WHITE Americans are Anglo-Saxon Protestants.  This excludes Eastern Europeans (particularly Romanians/Poles/Czech/Slovac), Middle Eastern peoples (also mostly Caucasian), and Mediterranean Europeans (Greeks, Italians, Spanish).  These groups are not privileged groups in the US, lumping an working class ethnic Polish-American with the upper class WASP is not correct. 
Kinda gross.

No, it's the **projection of the force on the direction of the motion**. Not projection on the rope direction!   You can connect the force to the object in whatever way you want, with ropes running at any angle you like. As long as the direction of the force and the direction of the motion remain the same, the force component in that direction is the same!    Using your logic, the force felt by the sleds will depend on the angle of the rope. Do you see the problem?

Blizzard can't really do anything. There's nothing in-game that can be given that translates to real money.  In Eve, the PLEX (30 day pilot's license extension) is a way to buy game time with in-game items (currency). And thus translates directly to money through CCP, approximately one month worth of money.   CCP are being very tricksy with this. They technically don't lose any money since someone else has paid for this, yet they're probably getting it written off as a deductible.

Is this something we are meant to see as serious and tragic? Cause if so that is the most unintentionally hilarious storyline ever. Guy must live in some weird bubble if he has to make up shit like that as a relatable type of problem another human being would have to deal with.  I predict his next "serious" storyline  will involve a characters descent into depression after his heretofore unmentioned Canadian zookeeper best friend commits suicide after the gorilla he spent 8 years teaching sign language signs that she hates him. And the funeral is crashed by the Newfoundland mafia.

&gt;I don't care that the App Store is a closed system. I can jailbreak for myself and I think the closed system works better for most users.  The problem is that that still leaves you at the whim of Apple. If they want to break your iPad they can. If they don't want to they still might., albeit on accident. People can't write their own apps for it; they have to go through the app store.

You can blame that trend on Reagan-era deficit spending.  The present reform is meant to reduce the deficit, government and private spending.

It's not a long book, but you could do far worse than look at the relevant Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy pages:  Start with:  http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/freewill/  Then maybe:  http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/incompatibilism-theories/  http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/incompatibilism-arguments/  and **definitely**  http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/compatibilism/  redditors seem to have a bit of a blind-spot for compatibilism.  then from there you'll know the kind of direction you'll want to take your reading in.  The *Oxford Readings In ...* series is usually pretty good for collecting influential and interesting papers.

Im gonna tell you the story, and it will seem like total bullshit, but suspend your disbelief for 5 seconds.  The story I'm about to tell is true:   So we're sitting there discussing this naming conundrum, when all of a sudden... 5 Pirates come walking down the street. Out of no where. I bullshit you not.  It was divinely bizarre, like a message from a higher power... what that message may be is open for discussion... but it was far too perfect to be coincidence.    EDIT: I'm a little fuzzy on what we were actually talking about at the time, so I added the naming part for dramatic effect.  The picture we took of them is actually the SECOND time they crossed our path... when we were outside chopping it up with the Greenpeace folks.
I lived in Orlando for a few years. In the tiny downtown area where all the bars/clubs are (Orange Ave. specifically, for anyone who knows it), there was always a preacher on the corner every weekend night, holding a sign with a laundry list of those who will be damned to hell.  I had been jumping around the bars for a while and getting really drunk, and in between bars I saw the preacher and suddenly got really angry at the sign he was holding, so I went up to him and said, "Both of us are going to die, but at least I'll have enjoyed my life."  I didn't see, or don't remember his reaction, but I walked away feeling a little satisfied.
I do that with every game I play.  It's more fun for me if I can somehow get inside the mind of the character.  I once played a perverted Morrowind character who liked to strip all the clothes off dead humanoid females and wear their skirt or pants around until he found a new victim.  He also, location permitting, would take a nap on their naked corpse after the kill.

Thank you for your post.  From reading reddit comments for a couple of years, it's safe to say there are a lot of us who are, IRL, loners, geeks, misfits, nerds and otherwise socially awkward individuals.   The reddit community creates a sense of belonging without all the crap that real life encounters often bring. That makes reddit a very special place for all of us. :)  Sending lots of positive thoughts to you as you work your way beyond the past's devastation.

The fact that you're reaching some common ground with me is actually making my mood a lot better, and for that I thank you. Even if our whole conversation has been about "reactions based on the opinion of another", I do hope you don't have an *entirely* terrible image of me from this encounter. Even if you do, then I suppose I can't change that. Good luck, and happy redditing :)

when i started using ubuntu (and for the most part linux) back during Warty Warthog, i'd install it and log in and was just blown away by how much faster Ubuntu/Gnome was over my WinXP install.  This is no longer the case.  My XP install is a ton faster than Ubuntu.  I wouldn't say the same about an Arch (or gentoo) + *box/twm setup though.  Furthermore, Firefox on linux sucks nuts.  It's getting worse on Windows too, but startup time, browsing speed, javascript speed in linux all suffer greatly.  As does Flash performance.    Office Suite software in Linux is also very slow to load and to perform.  It's not just Ubuntu, or just Gnome or KDE or the Apps it's all of it.  Win7 performs better.

Honestly, the only way I could see it being done is as a faux documentary that adds another frame to the story, more or less a sequel that also recovers the original story, rather than a direct adaptation.  In a way, that would fit the spirit of the story.  A direct adaptation is just plain impossible.

I disagree. When you burn a flag you are pissing on the entire nation in effigy.   I don't think you should get thrown in jail or anything like that, but you are really just being a massive pain in the ass and failing to make a point at all. Unless you just hate *the flag*.

If you fart in front of someone and they take offense and leave, then it was a pretty shallow relationship to begin with, and I would bet that something equally as shallow would eventually break the two of you up anyway, farts or no.   Trying to not fart is ridiculous. Everyone farts. Everyone knows everyone else farts. Avoiding that fact is like trying to convince your partner that you never have to pee or eat.  Eat some beans. Get it over with. Be the first to break the ice. Laugh. Continue on with your relationship.

Considering that you think the only way to get one is by intentionally downloading and running cutesy executable files, you aren't in a position to know if you had one.  Note that I'm not making the argument that anti-virus software is perfect, or that some anti-virus applications themselves can't introduce additional risks.

So why can't the authors of the site write whatever they want, and reference whatever content they want? Sure, we've all seen it before, they just put a different spin on it.   There is very little original content out there, it's more about what you can find than what you can make yourself.

Just browsing the site shows how biased they are.  They conclude that you always lose sensitivity after circ by asking 5 men.  I just got it done 6 weeks ago and I havent noticed a change in sensitivity at all.  Some people report highten sensitivity.  I've perused that site before a couple times for 2 years, it's clearly pointing people in one direction.  I didn't mean to attack the article you posted however, I did not check the citations.  I also kind of assume already infants experience mass amounts of pain.  And that has to be scarring in some way.  No one I know remembers it though so its hard to say...  I was just mentioning I've found that site to be the Fox News of circ sites.  And i've done massive amounts of researching to prepare for the op.
thanks dude.. who the f*** decides if its an own goal or no?? Everyone from reddit will agree tht the first goal was Nani's goal. The guy who decided its an Almunia own goal is a f***** racist.
If you can manage to die in bed (always iffy, I haven't been able to give up motorcycling yet) and select the Cadillac of cryonics companies (Alcor), they do have various levels of standby, including flying you out to Arizona so they can vitrify you immediately when you're on your deathbed.

I'm always amazed at stuff like this. Did the artist have the outline of Conan's face drawn on the board? I can't imagine figuring out the shading when you're working with such a big piece.

My brothers are spectacular at catching grapes with their mouth. On several occasions I've personally watched one of them toss a grape over our two story house and have the other catch it.

In the unincorporated area around Tucson Arizona, this is already how it's done, and it does indeed work. If your house catches fire and you haven't paid for fire service, they show up to make sure your neighbors' houses don't burn. Every few years it makes the paper when some jackass tries to call them and write a check on the spot, but they won't take it, and his garage burns down while the firemen watch.
The problem with Starbucks VIA is that it costs a hell of a lot more than any other instant coffee on the market. And instant coffee is one of the least cost effective ways to drink coffee already. The amount of coffee you get per dollar is abysmal versus brewing your own, only eclipsed by actual Starbucks coffee, which is crazy ripoff expensive.
As a non-Jew non-Muslim American, I can be disturbed by what I see going on there. But there is conflict all around the world. So this situation is not unique. However, as an American, I should be outraged by any support we are providing to enable these actions. The US should immediately withdraw any and all support of the Israel government and associated organizations. And just as the US Government clamps down on private funding of extremist organizations like the Tamil Tigers or Taliban, the US Government should regulate and/or ban private funding to these extremist Jewish organizations. Especially considering the incestuous relationship they appear to have with the government.      You will never be able to stop all conflict and fighting in the world, but you can pull back your support to ensure you are not involved. And take other state actions such as multinational sanctioning, if required.

i haven't tried it regularly (yet) but there seems to be something going on with it. Check out the Paleo diet, pretty interesting stuff, and I've read many advocates of the diet that recommend it.   Also I have a music professor this semester from India (I'm taking a Music of India - although really it's going to be a culture of India class) that was talking about diet and he said it was standard for them to fast every 15 days. He also talked heavily on eating the same things consistently day to day being one of the best things for your diet.

This isn't an argument to *not* spay or neuter pets, but I'm pretty sure the reason we do it is so we don't have to deal with their offspring.  You can look at it as "compassion[ate]" with respect to the fact stray kittens and puppies aren't being dumped on the side of the road in cardboard boxes every other minute, but you're still neglecting the fact that half the reason we do it is so we avoid having to deal with a big problem *that would otherwise occur quite naturally*.

&gt;if you want to find links relevant to some topic then you need to start using google without a "site:reddit.com" specifier.  That does nothing.  That will return every single link that contains a comment about the word being searched.  That would be a very very retarded way to try to find links/topics that have the word haiti in them.  If you did it by keyword and titles, when you search haiti you will only get topics/links/threads where the link is about haiti.  If I wanted to find random comments about haiti, google would work great.  But if I want to find links/topics/threads(all the same thing on reddit) google would be a terrible way.  I would need to search titles for the word haiti and hopefully links without the word haiti in the topic have the keyword haiti attached to them for search purposes.  I do find it funny that you are repeating something that is a blatantly terrible way to search.

I think the whole speech is excellent and explains it very well. Free speech is easy if everyone already gets along and agrees. That is not how the world works though, if you want free speech, real free speech then you have to be willing to allow speech that makes you angry. If burning a flag gets you pissed off then it shows that it is an effective form of protest. Protests are supposed to stir emotions, get people angry. Whether or not it helps their cause is another story.   
I disagree when it comes to harder drugs, which is clearly what the OP was involved with.  In fact, selling someone Heroin is still putting them at risk.

it can also help it if you literally stretch the tire.

Israel easily wins the public opinion war in the United States because it is a western like democracy of white people against a group of brown people who as far as many in this country are concerned are all terrorists.  If and when Palestinians can reject violence and leadership like Hamas they will have a chance at turning the opinion of the American people.  That is the sad reality of the situation.  Any violence will just be seen as terrorism.   You may think Israel is more concerned with American politicians, but you would be wrong, they are most concerned with American public opinion.

well, the main reason I think is that it's nearly impossible to find eggs that are *actually* cruelty free. Even on personal back country farms chicks often are kept in muddy cages with little or no access to grass and many are slaughtered in the end (though they have longer lives than CAFO chickens). Also, personally owned chickens still likely come from a hatchery which is ethically the same as a puppy mill. one reason for some vegans is the enslavement of the chickens for the pleasure of human beings. Health vegans say it's the cholesterol and fat. That.. and it's just kind of disgusting to eat another animal's menses product. You get rid of an egg every month too but I'm sure you'd find it disgusting if people ate that.

It's freshest as a bean so when you do grind it, make sure you keep it in an air tight container. Actually, I would just keep it in an air tight container either way. Lastly, make sure it's been ground for a french press. Most Starbucks will grind your coffee for free, even if you didn't purchase it there. As for the steep time, 3:30 sounds about right (if I remember correctly).   Im sure you already knew some of this but I figured I'd share all I know.  Hope it helps :)
Although you are right, it's worth pointing out that being Christian or Muslim is something anyone can in theory embrace and adopt...Jews are by nature exclusionary. For the most part you gotta be born into it.

Utd fan here. In Gallas' defense he was really their only threat once they pushed forward. He is pretty remarkable in the air. I was biting my nails the last 20 minutes when Arsenal put together some quality passing moves and played crosses into the box with the likes of Gallas and Vermaelen being the only guys who can attack a header for the Gunners. I mean shit, they played a short squad!

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Phelps  The most intriguing part is that he used to be a civil rights advocate until one day he went crazy in court against a court reporter (which led to his disbarment) and found out that being evil gets shit done and gets attention. I like to think that he's actually the most effective kind of civil rights protester out there because he gladly makes himself the enemy of decency and through the irony of his own displays of intolerance, shows the true nature of hatred that runs deep through humanity and our disdain of happiness and love. He's happy to be the man everyone is allowed to hate.  Or maybe he just went insane.

Well, it was technically 'clothing optional' except if you wanted to go in the pool you had to be nude.  We had a night club, and most people would dress up in lingerie and cute costumes (think Halloween year round).  A typical day as a patron of the resort was tan all day naked, drink all day in the sun and in the pool.  Have a game of water volleyball in the afternoon before lunch, tan more, drink more.  At around 5 the place would clear out and everyone would either eat at our restaurant or have dinner at home, shower, then come to the club in a cute outfit and dance and drink till 3.
I doubt this means very little to you, but:  "small businesses" mean a lot to the oregon economy and we need every job we can get, especially during times like this. And if you had read absolutely anything, it would have become apparent that they are taxing revenue (i.e. total income *before* deductions).   Please take the time to inform yourself on matters like this before flying off the handle about how "utter CRAP" something is, or even worse, voting in our state.

It's most likely because when you are pulling a single sled, you are holding the rope at a higher level than the front of the sled and, thus, pulling up on it, which will make it bog down into the snow less.  When pulling one behind the other, there is not that lifting action on the second sled.

Ha. It's pretty obvious when it is and isn't an own goal. The ball, as it left Nani's foot, wasn't going to go into the net. Watch the replay. It clearly would've gone clear across the face of goal (at best, it would've clipped the post). Of course, Park happened to be right about where it would've landed, and probably would have been able to quite simply redirect it past Almunia.  The point is, though, the ball wasn't going to go in without a redirection from someone. It was not on target. As Almunia was the one who redirected it into the net, it's an own goal. It's pretty obvious from the replay.  That doesn't mean Nani doesn't deserve full credit for the setup, though. That was some really brilliant work from him to get it into that position, especially the way he shedded two defenders in the blink of an eye.

Physicist here: If you were pulling the two sleds such that the ropes were not parallel to the direction of motion (sleds touching side-by-side), then it requires *more* force to overcome friction than if the rope is straight, as in the one-sled case.  This is why carrying a shopping bag that has bulky contents seems heavier: because the handles are not hanging vertically and only part of the force you are exerting goes into pulling the sled or the shopping bag. **Edit:** [pic](http://imgur.com/xX2w7)

Exactly my point, which I think you missed.  Apple didn't invent the mobile phone, they just made a significant improvement that changed not only the handset market, but the mobile service providers as well.  The Sony Ericsson phones had most of the capabilities that the Blackberry did (save push). If the iPhone didn't raise the competition, we'd see a much different landscape.  Do you think that the Blackberry offering after the iPhone improved or stayed the same?

I can't speak for Unix, but on Windows a shared library (DLL) takes effectively no time to load if it is already in use by another running program, whereas statically linked libraries are always loaded because they're part of the executable's binary.  Thus there's only one copy of the DLL version of the C run-time library in memory at any time.  So in that case, dynamic linking (like Dr. Who) saves both time and space.
Also, when choosing your Biotic shield person, make sure they're loyal.  I had Jack for my shield, but she wasn't loyal (fight with Miranda).  I ended up losing Samara to the collector bird things at the end of that sequence.  Then, Jack died later because she wasn't loyal.  Aggravating.

Not true. The pressures required to melt ice are immense. [WolframAlpha](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=melting+point+of+water+at+-5C) gives something in the order of thousands of atmospheres.   This is also the reason why ice skates are supposed to work, but again, the pressures are still too high for this explanation to be true.  If we model the sled as a simple mass on a surface, then the friction force is related only to the mass. (F=umg) Surface area or pressure does not affect the friction force. (See [Leemy's post](http://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/awgd3/scientists_explain_this_to_me_why_do_pulling_two/c0jr0w9)) Unless this is one of those tricky boundary conditions, which I don't think it is, but whatever...  My explanation is that it's harder simply because you have the added weight of one sled in the second scenario.

I suggest you set up some ground rules and follow them. Such as, no TV or distractions from 9 to 5.  When your not working on client materials and don't foresee any new contracts in the works, keep up on your skills. I personally like to try new designs and templatize them while I have downtime.  Get yourself health insurance, and don't forget to continue your retirement investment plan.  Set up a proper work station. Just cause your now working from home doesn't mean you shouldn't be using an efficient work station.  Since there are 8 million other freelancers out there doing the same thing as you, word of mouth and networking will be huge. Even though you are the expert, the client is still king, and that should be remembered if you want referral work. Therefore, choose your battles when it comes to differences in the website direction.  And most importantly, your doing this cause you want to. Have fun with it! Enjoy.

Considering how little we know about gauging the intelligence of species we currently share the planet with, I suppose it's not totally outside the realm of possibility of their being a quite intelligent dinosaur in the terms you speak of.

Unfortunately, Kona is an expensive coffee.  It's a supply and demand thing so the price will always stay high whether it's profitable to grow or not.  Assuming you're really getting 100% Kona, $30 per pound is a decent price for the mainland.  100% Kona is difficult to find outside of Hawaii.  If you're paying $30 for a Kona Blend though, then you're actually just overpaying for a cheap non-Kona coffee.  I charge $25 per pound and that's the farm direct price.  Any cheaper and I would be giving the coffee away for less than it costs to grow.  There are plenty of people that don't like Kona coffee but there are also plenty of people that do.  So you'll have to make up your own mind whether or not it's worth the price.  On a side note, can you get me the name of your roaster?  I'm hoping I can get them to buy their green beans from me rather than whoever they're currently using.  They're probably happy with their current supplier but in this economy it's worth asking.

How does the bail bond thing work?  Everything I know about Bail Bonds, I learned from watching a few episodes of "Dog the Bounty Hunter". :)  Sooo...  you needed $100k to get out of jail.

Since you didn't show up, the bail bond place is out $85k.  Several people in this thread were saying "oh, don't worry.. the bail bond place doesn't have to pay out $100k" -- but they DID have to pay that for you to get out, yes?  So.. back to Dog the Bounty Hunter...  this bail bond place has their own guys, or hires out somebody like Dog, to look for you???  And then if Dog finds you and brings you in, the jail municipality gives the $100k back to the bail bond place... and the bail bond place gives a portion of this $100k to Dog.    Is that how it works??

Yes, except the municipality will settle with the bail bondsmen for a fraction of what the bond was originally.

Anything you've been using for years is going to be "easier to use" than anything you switch to.  It's exactly why windows users think that mac is harder to use, and why mac users thing windows is harder to use.  There's an actual term for this, but I can't remember it.
I actually haven't been able to confirm that it does or doesn't, but everything that's out there on the device points to an upscaled Ipod so I don't really expect it to. The Ipod screen uses projected capacitance so you have to use your bare fingers. Even a light pair of gloves is enough to prevent your touch from being detected. There are ways around the limitations of PCT but unless the Ipad is intended to be used with a stylus, none of the apps will be designed to take advantage of this form of input.

I'd just like to point out you are full of shit. The 1967 border thru Jerusalem was simply the front line between the Arab and Israeli forces on the day the ceasefire of the 1948 war went into effect. there is nothing legal, planned or historical about it - the partition plan that created Israel intended Jerusalem to have a separate status as an international city under UN administration. Jordan controlled East Jerusalem and the entire Old City 1948-1967 (in fact they annexed it to be a permanent part of Jordan and gave everyone citizenship).   Please refer me to a legal document/ruling or a UN resolution that states that the parts of Jerusalem under Jordanian control till 1967 (including the Temple Mount and Jewish Quarter of the Old City) belongs TO A PALESTINIAN STATE.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positions_on_Jerusalem

It's actually not Dec 25th or any winter date at all. The reason why we have Christmas on Dec 25th is because it was a pagan holiday celebrating the noticeable shortening of daylight. When Christian evangelists (crusaders?) converted them, they just made their most popular holiday their own to make the conversion smoother.  I believe Christ's birthday was more around April or something.  Edit: [wiki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas)

Well I've gone a bit rusty since after high school I haven't had much chance to practice English nor haven't I traveled anymore.  2 weeks and more? This is crazy.

You're absolutely right, I have t as the variable but I was taking the antiderivative with respect to b for some reason. Goodness I'm rusty.  Thanks!

Their jobs are different, but in terms of education they're surprisingly similar. Vet school is ludicrously hard to get into (quite a bit harder than medical school, actually), costs an arm and a leg, and shoves its students out the door with massive debt into low-wage jobs. Medicine between humans and animals isn't as different as you might think.  The big differences are that veterinarians are rarely sued for malpractice, people are willing to spend more to save their own lives than their pets', and there is very little veterinary insurance out there.  Not that doctors don't deserve more, they're obviously working in a much higher risk and higher stress environment.

It was pointed out to me by the [Economist Magazine](http://www.economist.com/blogs/lexington/), "Lexington" column, Jan 21, 2010.   In the United States obese is defined as BMI &gt; 30 (there are levels of class 1,2,&amp;3 also called severe, morbid or super obese); overweight is defined as BMI&gt; 25 (these definitions may be global).    **67% of American adults are overweight or obese** and **43% of Americans have zero tax liability**.

&gt;Not true. The pressures required to melt ice are immense.   Not at all. Hang a small weight from a loop of wire, then dangle the weight from an icecube. The wire melts the ice below it due to the pressure, then sinks, and the water immediately re-freezes above the wire. The weighted loop will eventually pass right through the ice, leaving the icecube completely intact.

Not sure why the down votes.  I think you are 100% correct.  I struggle with this frequently (mostly because I like to overreact and am overly sensitive).  It's so easy to just say "fuck it" and start a relationship with someone new. 
If you have a high tolerance for unconventional (but gripping, and often hilarious) narrative, the films of Jean-Luc Godard (one of the founders of the French New Wave) are a must:  * Breathless (1960) * Contempt (1963) * Band of Outsiders (1964) * Pierrot Le Fou (1965) * Alphaville (1965) * Weekend (1967)

A few years ago at a friend's house for dinner and there is this moth fluttering around inside. We're all about to sit down and someone mentions the moth.  I'm standing over near the window which is open but has a screen over it. In the screen in a tiny tear - like the size of a coin.  I say "hey moth - come out through this hole".  Immediately the moth (which is about four metres away in the kitchen) turns and flies straight toward me and out the tiny hole.  Everyone stands there, stunned.

Sorry dude, yours is a high school mistake. Look into it, and I'm sure you'll figure it out.    Here's food for thought: what if you had two ropes instead of one, with different angles, which one would you choose to calculate the force?    What if you had three V-shaped ropes like you drew instead of one? What if you were pulling on a solid triangular brace attached to the sleds, which angle would you choose then?  I'm not gonna argue with you, but if you care about it, ask a Physics prof or someone else with a firm grip on mechanics. They may be able to explain it better than me typing on a keyboard a thousand miles away.

In the wilderness, a gun is more than a defense against bears, although that's the reason most guys say they carry one.  Sure, it might be useful if you get into an altercation with a bear, but the chances are low.  The gun is also a a signaling device, a way of getting food and shelter, and a firestarting aid.  You might get stuck out there for awhile.  A gun is just a common-sense tool to bring with you in the wilderness for more reasons than simple defense against predators.

The E-Ink thing is very different than a mobile phone or lcd computer display.  It doesn't have a back light and basically puts black text on a paper colored background.

As a Libertarian, I am not swayed by tax cuts.  Tax cuts alone are disastrous if they are not paired with spending cuts as well.  Since the GOP is as much a big spender as anybody else, bribing us with tax cuts isn't effective in getting my vote. 
Yes, nobody put the gun to my friend's head. However, I do not believe he was educated enough about the consequences, nor do I believe anyone is. I do not believe I have ever heard of a regular user of Heroin who has been in control over their drug habits.  After all, being educated is not a solve-all for stupid decisions. Peer pressure is a very powerful influence on people, whether we admit it or not. Additionally, people are naive. They can be educated to any point about the risks of ingesting something, and yet still do it because they are young and thus invulnerable to what's otherwise dangerous to everyone else.  I respect your opinion, however I find it misguided. I think your outlook on the world is far too trusting of people to make the right decisions.
&gt;These guy's don't even really believe what they're saying.  I don't buy it.

Kids in general are just crappy actors, and even worse at improv. 
So, take it up with private companies which charge more than ten times the price when they know it's a government contract.  &gt;As for the air fares, Hammill explained they are "government rate."

I like Arab culture, but the language is utterly useless when it comes to the regions I'd want to work in after leaving the military. As for Chinese, I don't really even like the food, much less anything else about the country.   I'm all for supporting my host country, but going into the linguistics field seems like it would develop a set of skills so specialised that I wouldn't want to waste the opportunity by learning a language which I would never actually use outside of the military. 
Neither "Paris" nor "Menelaus" rhymes with "Wham". Priam was at the king of the city that was holding Hellen, so I took some license in writing a stupid one liner. The jury of upvoters seems to side with you on this one, but I don't think there are a lot of people who have heard of Priam and not Paris.
Next time they come through my town, I plan to have a sign that says "GOD HATES WHAT I HATE" with smaller letters under it: "HOW CONVENIENT".
I agree. But it's also the foundation of the collapse of "communism" as we know it. Soviet bureaucratic industrialized communism is only one of many possible societies that can be built from a foundation of a guaranteed decent standard of living. That foundation keeps a society honest, because it requires it to maintain itself through work that people find so enjoyable and meaningful that they will still do the work even if their survival and comfort do not depend on it.  I think it's possible to build a society that guarantees a decent standard of living and does not collapse but thrives, and if we keep trying, we might figure it out in as little as 1000 years.
The Military ain't about "fair" it's all about discrimination based on conduct, friend and foe alike.  Tolerating gay has been a civilian social experiment.
